279621,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eti%C3%A4inen,Etiäinen,"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own.  One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.","In Finnish folklore, all places and things, animate or inanimate, have a spirit or ""etiäinen"" that lives there. Etiäinen can manifest in many forms, but is usually described as a kind, elderly woman with white hair. She is the guardian of natural places and often helps people in need. 

Etiäinen has been a part of Finnish culture for centuries and is still widely believed in today. Folklorists study etiäinen to understand Finnish traditions and how they have changed over time.",1,187,80,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Etiäinen'

As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.","Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups inhabiting the Maluku Islands.

The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.","In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a theorem stating that for any given set of available resources, there exists a unique unemployment equilibrium in which there are no unemployed people.

The full employment theorem is a result of the theory of market equilibrium and was first proposed by Pareto in 1895. The theorem states that if the market has the ability to create full employment, then there will be no unemployment.

There are a few conditions that must be met for the theorem to hold:
1) There must be enough resources available to meet demand.
2) The market must be able to create jobs at the same rate as people enter and leave the workforce.

Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history.  The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts.  The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians.  The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent.  
  
The original watercolour painting, together with three others in a series by Cleveley, was put up for auction by Christie's auction house in London in 2004.

These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European. The majority of the population of Madagascar today is a mixture of Austronesian and Bantu settlers. Despite popular belief, there has been no genetic input from Arabs or Indians, although one tribe, the Antemoro, claims descent from Somali Arab traders.

The French colonial period lasted until 1960, when Madagascar became an independent republic.

Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors.

Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters.

The book is a comparative history of the cities of Richland, in the northwest United States adjacent to the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site plutonium production area, and Ozersk, in Russia's southern Ural mountain region. These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. Brown argues that the demands of plutonium production – both the danger of the physical process and the secrecy required in the Cold War context – led both US and Soviet officials to create ""Plutopias,"" ideal communities to placate resident families in exchange for their cooperation and control over their bodies. This entailed creating significant state-run welfare programs along with high levels of consumerism in both places.

Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sick leave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits.","A full-time job is employment in which a person works a set number of hours each week, typically 40 hours. In some countries, full-time employment is the norm, while in others it is less common. 

The term ""full-time job"" can refer to a variety of different types of employment, including traditional jobs where a person works a set number of hours each day, week, or month, as well as part-time jobs where a person works fewer hours each week than 40. In some cases, people may work full time but be paid for fewer hours worked than 40 per week because their employer operates on a shift system. 

There are many reasons why people might work full time instead of part time.

Full-time jobs can offer benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid vacation days.",2,174,160,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Full-time job'

Known largely for his skills as a fielder – for he found only moderate success with the bat – Eaglestone enjoys the unusual distinction of having featured in two different County Championship-winning sides in consecutive seasons. Career
Eaglestone was drawn to cricket after leaving school in 1938 when he joined the groundstaff at Lord's Cricket Ground. He played for the Middlesex Second XI that year. A left-handed batsman, Eaglestone enjoyed limited success after a promising debut first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in which he scored 77 in a 128-run partnership with Denis Compton. Having securing selection for Middlesex, he scored zero in his first outing for the county side, and though he made 55 in his next game he would score only seven half-centuries during his career and finish with a batting average of 15.77. 
 
Eaglestone played only seven matches for Middlesex in that solitary season for the club, scoring 151 runs. He decided to move to Glamorgan at the end of that year's County Championship – of which Middlesex were crowned champions. He played for Glamorgan in the 1948 season, and Glamorgan were victorious in that year's County Championship also – their maiden County Championship victory. This meant that Eaglestone had featured in Championship winning teams for two successive summers. His own contributions, however, were relatively modest.

Natural night vision, or scotopic vision, is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, rod cells are exclusively responsible for night vision as cone cells are only able to function at higher illumination levels. Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in resolution and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen.  In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a dark adaptation period of up to two hours in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence ""setting"", increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude.  This adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of photopigments to increase retinal sensitivity. Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds. Efficiency 
The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine orders of magnitude. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a contrast ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.","In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the eyes to change their response to a changed visual environment. It is a physiological process that underlies the detection and interpretation of images by the brain.

Adaptation is an important process in vision because it enables us to detect objects and scenes that are changing rapidly, such as when we are moving or when something new is happening. Our eyes usually adapt quickly to changes in our environment, but sometimes they can't adapt fast enough or they adapt in the wrong way. This can lead to problems with our vision, like when we can't see in low light or when we get headaches from viewing bright lights.

There are two main types of adaptation: positive and negative. Positive adaptation occurs when the eyes become more sensitive to light, and negative adaptation occurs when the eyes become less sensitive to light.",2,237,147,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Adaptation (eye)'

Many boxing champions have fought in an orthodox stance. Alternative stances
The corresponding designation for a left-handed boxer is southpaw and is generally a mirror image of the orthodox stance. A southpaw boxer guards and jabs with their right hand. Some famous boxers who use southpaw are Marvelous Marvin Hagler,   Victor Ortiz, Sultan Ibragimov, Naseem Hamed, Joe Calzaghe, Manny Pacquiao, and Lucian Bute. Francisco Palacios, Andre Ward, and Terence Crawford normally fight as orthodox, but occasionally switch to a southpaw stance to confuse their opponents. Hagler was the opposite, normally fighting southpaw but able to switch to orthodox. Some fighters who are naturally left-handed fight in the orthodox stance with the advantage of a fast, hard jab and left hook, including Oscar De La Hoya, Sonny Liston, Miguel Angel Cotto, Gerry Cooney, and Marco Antonio Barrera. Likewise, Vasiliy Lomachenko is a naturally right-handed fighter who stands in the southpaw stance, as the same with Shakur Stevenson.","In combat sports such as boxing, an orthodox stance is a standing position with the feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, the weight shifted towards the ball of the foot, and the hands held close to the body.

The concept was first studied by Harald Bohr and later generalized by Vyacheslav Stepanov, Hermann Weyl and Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch, amongst others. There is also a notion of almost periodic functions on locally compact abelian groups, first studied by John von Neumann. Almost periodicity is a property of dynamical systems that appear to retrace their paths through phase space, but not exactly. An example would be a planetary system, with planets in orbits moving with periods that are not commensurable (i.e., with a period vector that is not proportional to a vector of integers). A theorem of Kronecker from diophantine approximation can be used to show that any particular configuration that occurs once, will recur to within any specified accuracy: if we wait long enough we can observe the planets all return to within a second of arc to the positions they once were in.","In mathematics, an almost periodic function is, roughly speaking, a function whose behavior appears to be periodic, but for which there is not a precise mathematical description.

Overview
WDM drivers are layered in a stack and communicate with each other via I/O request packets (IRPs). The Microsoft Windows Driver Model unified driver models for the Windows 9x and Windows NT product lines by standardizing requirements and reducing the amount of code that needed to be written. WDM drivers will not run on operating systems earlier than Windows 98 or Windows 2000, such as Windows 95 (before the OSR2 update that sideloads the WDM model), Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 3.1. By conforming to WDM, drivers can be binary compatible and source-compatible across Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista (for backwards compatibility) on x86-based computers. WDM drivers are designed to be forward-compatible so that a WDM driver can run on a version of Windows newer than what the driver was initially written for, but doing that would mean that the driver cannot take advantage of any new features introduced with the new version. WDM is generally not backward-compatible, that is, a WDM driver is not guaranteed to run on any older version of Windows.  For example, Windows XP can use a driver written for Windows 2000 but will not make use of any of the new WDM features that were introduced in Windows XP. However, a driver written for Windows XP may or may not load on Windows 2000.","In computing, the Windows Driver Model  (WDM) is the software architecture for drivers for the Windows operating system. It was first introduced with Windows 95 and has been refined since then. The WDM is a model-based system that sets out how different types of drivers interact with the operating system.

Described as a cross between The People's Court and Bowling for Dollars, the show had participants play against each other to settle feuds and win nearly worthless prizes. For example, in the second 1998 episode, a player received merchandise for a radio station that had been defunct for two years. Gift certificates for Old Country Buffet were common that year. Another episode gave a foodservice-sized can of tuna to the runner up, while the winner received a 2 gallon consumer-strength jug of Roundup.","Let's Bowl is a scripted bowling game show that aired on the ABC television network from January 11, 2007 to January 8, 2009.

The underlying legal concept of a transfer of development rights programme is the notion that all land has a bundle of property rights. It is used for controlling land use to complement land-use planning and zoning for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. Description 
The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. ","Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method of transferring development rights in a project from the original developer to another party. The term is most commonly used in the context of real estate development.

The purpose of TDR is to provide a way for the original developer to relinquish control of a project without having to sell the property or give up any ownership rights. This can be useful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the property.

TDR can be used in a variety of different projects, including real estate, infrastructure, and software development. Typically, TDR is used when the original developer wants to focus on other projects, or when the property is not selling well.

There are a number of different methods for transferring TDRs. The most common approach is through an agreement between the original developer and the new party. Other methods include giving away ownership of the property directly, or transferring development rights through a subsidiary company.

There are several advantages to using TDRs. First, it can provide a way for the original developer to exit a project without having to give up any ownership rights. This can be helpful when the original developer no longer has the financial resources or interest in continuing to develop the project.

Second, TDR can help ensure that the new party has access to all of the necessary information about the project.

The castle was built for Albin Woelflin, imperial bailiff for Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, around 1220. The site was acquired in 1227 by the lords of Horbourg and Ribeaupierre. It had an important strategic role as it allowed the Empire to close off one of the routes across the Vosges Mountains towards Lorraine. The circular keep is the oldest part of the castle and one of the first of this type in the upper Rhine valley. It was designed at the same time as the keep at the Château de Pflixbourg. The first curtain wall, which included the keep, was replaced after 1261 by a wall enclosing the keep, according to a contemporary plan, which allowed an uninterrupted circuit of the walls and strengthened defences on the side likely to be attacked. 
In the 14th century, the castle was the residence of the imperial provost or bailiff. Following a fire, the enceinte was raised to 4 m. In the second half of the 15th century, the castle defences were modernised in response to developments in artillery and firearms; the crenels were closed with wooden shutters, the merlons were equipped with firing slits and the round walk was completely covered. In this period, the castle was merely a sub-bailliage and personnel were heavily reduced. During the German Peasants' War (1524/5), the castle was besieged.

They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only in the sense that at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems.  In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100 V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100 V. Operation
Constant-voltage speaker systems are analogous to electrical power transmission methods employed by electric utility companies to transmit electric power over long distances. Typically, an electric utility will step up the voltage of the power transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current, hence reducing the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system, the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to reduce the voltage to a usable level.","Constant-voltage speaker systems refer to networks of loudspeakers where the power supply is held at a constantvoltage. This eliminates the need for a power amplifier, as the loudspeakers are always powered by the same voltage.

Constant-voltage speaker systems offer several advantages over traditional power amplifiers. First, they are less likely to suffer from ""sag"" or ""pumping"" in the audio signal, as the power supply is held constant. Second, they can be more efficient, as the power amplifier is not required to work at peak performance all the time. Finally, they can be more tightly controlled, as there is no need for multiple power amplifiers or switches to vary the power to different speakers.

Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Production
The production of a secretory protein starts like any other protein. The mRNA is produced and transported to the cytosol where it interacts with a free cytosolic ribosome. The part that is produced first, the N-terminal, contains a signal sequence consisting of 6 to 12 amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. This sequence is recognised by a cytosolic protein, SRP (Signal Recognition Particle), which stops the translation and aids in the transport of the mRNA-ribosome complex to an SRP receptor found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. When it arrives at the ER, the signal sequence is transferred to the translocon, a protein-conducting channel in the membrane that allows the newly synthesized polypeptide to be translocated to the ER lumen. The dissociation of SRP from the ribosome restores the translation of the secretory protein. The signal sequence is removed and the translation continues while the produced chain moves through the translocon (cotranslational translocation).","A secretory protein is any protein, whether produced by a cell or produced in the body, that is secreted from the cell into the extracellular space. This includes proteins that are released from cells in response to an external stimulus, such as activation of a signaling pathway, or proteins that are produced by cells on demand.

The Redpsotted Hawkfish was first formally described as Pseudocirrhites pinos in 1927 by the Bermudan naturalist Louis L. Mowbray with the type locality given as Point Francis on the Isle of Pines in Cuba. In 1829 the French zoologist Georges Cuvier described a species he called Cirrhites fasciatus, giving it a type locality of Puducherry in India. This is now considered to be an error, since the fish described most likely came from the Atlantic Ocean. When Theodore Nicholas Gill described the genus Amblycirrhitus in 1861 he used Cuvier's C. fasciatus as its type species. However, Cuvier's name was preoccupied by Edward Turner Bennett's 1828 usage of the name for a related species, A. pinos is the type species of Amblycirrhitus under Cuvier's invalid name.

The descendant of ethnic Romanian and Slovak miners, he was born in the Hungarian segment of Austria-Hungary. Raised by his mother after his father's death in World War I, he received financial support from local benefactors, who cultivated his artistic skill, particularly as a woodcarver. A citizen of Romania after the union of 1918, he was forced to drop out of school by economic circumstances, and worked for years in various industries and businesses, while also discovering his passion for beekeeping and gardening. He was drawn into far-left politics during the Great Depression, when he came to be influenced by radical artists such as Alexandru Ziffer, Aurel Popp, Vasile Kazar and Iosif Klein, who also introduced him to avant-garde experimentation. Vida was co-opted into the Union of Communist Youth and subsequently the Communist Party, producing propaganda art for both; this activity led to his temporary arrest in 1932 and 1933. A labor organizer, he helped establish the Artists' Trade Union and its branch in Baia Mare. Having trained as a gunner in the Romanian Land Forces, Vida made repeated attempts at joining the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. Though imprisoned and expelled upon illegally crossing the border with Czechoslovakia, he resumed the effort and finally reached Republican Spain in early 1938.

The modern city of Domokos occupies its site. At this place, says Livy, the traveller, after traversing rugged mountains and intricate valleys, comes suddenly in sight of an immense plain like a vast sea, the extremity of which is scarcely visible. From the astonishment which it excited in the traveller, the city was supposed to have derived its name. It stood upon a lofty and precipitous rock. It was besieged by Philip V of Macedon in 199 BCE; but a reinforcement of Aetolians having made their way into the town, the king was obliged to abandon the siege. Thaumaci was taken by the consul Acilius in the war with Antiochus, 191 BCE. The modern town of Domokos occupies the site of Thaumaci, and at this place inscriptions were found containing the ancient name. Its situation and prospect are in exact accordance with the description of Livy, who copied from Polybius, an eye-witness. William Martin Leake observes that ""at the southern end of the town a rocky point, overtopping the other heights, commands a magnificent prospect of the immense plain watered by the Peneius and its branches."" The town was Christianised at an early date and a bishopric was set up (see Thaumacensis).","Thaumaci or Thaumacus , was a town in ancient Arcadia, in the territory of Pheneus.

She has been called ""the most iconoclastic""  of contemporary sociologists and her approach represents the major alternative to the mainstream approaches in social science. Throughout her analyses, she emphasizes the empirical foundation of claims that she makes about human thought and action, underlining the importance of logical consistency between different sources of evidence as well as between the many interrelated hypotheses that come together to help us explain complex human phenomena. Because our thought and action are rarely limited to one, conveniently isolated sphere of human existence but rather occur within the context of more than one area of our reality at the same time (e.g. the political, the religious, the economic, the artistic, etc.) Greenfeld highlights the fact that an empirical study of humanity must necessarily be interdisciplinary.

They were designed and built by the Public Works Department. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 and 15 November 2002 respectively. History 
Waverley Reservoir No. 1, completed in 1887, was the last of four reservoirs built to augment the Botany Swamps Scheme (1858-1886). The other three reservoirs included: 
 Crown Street Reservoir, 1859
 Paddington Reservoir, 1864 (disused and no longer owned by Sydney Water), and 
 Woollahra Reservoir, 1880. 
However Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) was not supplied solely by Botany Swamps Water, because by 1886 the Hudson Scheme had come on line, supplying water from the Upper Nepean, prior to the completion of that Scheme in 1888. Water was pumped from Woollahra Reservoir for the first six years of its service, then from Crown Street Reservoir in 1893. From 1927 onwards Waterloo Pumping Station took over supply of the reservoir. The Waverley Reservoirs were the highest of the reservoirs intended to be supplied by Botany Swamps. However it soon became apparent that additional height was required for reticulation purposes. This led to the construction of two elevated steel tanks in 1894 (now demolished). With increasing demand, these tanks were eventually superseded by the present Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) and Waverley Reservoir No. 2, both completed in 1917. Final augmentation of supply took place in 1938 with the construction of Waverley Reservoir No. 3.","The Waverley Reservoirs are four reservoirs, of which two are located in the Central Highlands of Tasmania, Australia.

A woman who recently divorced her husband petitioned the court to determine whether the marriage, resulting from a Nikah, was void marriage or a non-marriage. The Family Court had held the marriage was void, granting her financial remedies. The Court of Appeal subsequently reversed the decision and denied financial remedies. The case received much scholarly and media attention on the requirements for marriage and the protection of vulnerable spouses. Context 
The Marriage Act 1949 and Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 set out conditions for a marriage ceremony to be recognized as valid, void, voidable or outside the Marriage Acts. A valid marriage satisfies all the conditions in the Marriage Acts; the parties may benefit from all the legal consequences such as equitable division of property and pension sharing. A void marriage fails one of the 'essential requirements' in the Marriage Act; a decree of nullity can be granted which allows the parties to get the same financial remedies as on divorce. A voidable marriage is one that can be annulled at the option of one of the parties if one of the grounds are met. A 'non-marriage' is outside the Marriage Acts, with the parties treated as cohabiting couples.",", also known as Attorney General v.

From cropmarks in the ""policies"" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus.

It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.","Figure-ground contrast, in the context of mapmaking, is the difference between the shapes and sizes of the features depicted on a map and the spaces around them. The term generally applies to maps of real or imaginary landscapes, but can also be used for maps of abstract concepts.

Figure-ground contrast is an important consideration in mapmaking because it affects how viewers interact with a map. For instance, if most of the features on a map are large and well-defined, viewers may feel overwhelmed and lose their sense of orientation. If, on the other hand, most features are small and subtle, viewers may be more likely to notice and appreciate them.

In cartography, figure-ground contrast is often achieved through the use of scale. Large features are typically drawn at a larger scale than smaller features, in order to make them more noticeable. Conversely, smaller features are typically drawn at a smaller scale than larger features, in order to preserve their visibility.

Figure-ground contrast is also important for portraying information on a map. For instance, if a map contains a lot of information about one specific area, it may be difficult to see if that information is balanced among the various features on the map.

Nanao Castle is located on the southeastern side of Noto Peninsula facing the Sea of Japan. The area was important from the Nara period due to its good port and connections with neighbouring provinces. In 1408, Hatakeyama Mitsunori, from a branch line of the Hatakeyama clan, was appointed governor of Noto Province and first constructed a castle at this location around the year 1408. Although the main Hatakeyama clan diminished in power and influence with the growing strength of the Ashikaga clan under the Muromachi shogunate, the Hatakeyama in Noto ruled their area as a semi-independent fief. Hatakeyama Yoshifusa (1491-1545) expanded Nanao Castle into a huge fortress. However, after his death, the Hatakeyama suffered from internal conflicts with the clan and with increasing restive powerful retainers, and problems with the Ikkō-ikki movement.","was a Muromachi period yamajiro-style Japanese castle located in the city of Nanao, Aichi Prefecture.

The candidate planet was discovered by means of variable star timing, which measured anomalies in variability of the star caused by a planet. It is the first planet candidate to claim to be detected with this method. The discovery reported the planet candidate to have mass of 3.2 times Jupiter's (assuming an edge-on orbit), semi-major axis of 1.7 AU, and orbital period of 1,170 days. The planet candidate was discovered in March 2007 and published in September 2007. If it is confirmed, its survival would indicate that planets at Earth-like distances can survive their star's red-giant phase, though this is a much larger planet than Earth (about the same size as Jupiter and Saturn). Its existence has been called into question with further monitoring of the pulsations of the star which show deviations from the predicted behavior if this were in fact a planet.

The popular uprising was also against the prevailing feudal system controlled by elite Hindus. The British had appointed high caste Hindus in positions of authority to get their support, this led to the protest turning against the Hindus.

The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel"". Example
An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting ""judicial murder"". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court.","Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of a judge, prosecutor, or other judicial officer. It is a form of assassination.

Judicial murder is a form of assassination that has been seen in many countries around the world. Judicial murder is most commonly associated with countries that have a history of instability and corruption. In some cases, judicial murder has been used to quash investigations into political corruption and to remove political opponents from power. Judicial murder can also be used to intimidate judges and prosecutors from carrying out their duties.

Judicial murder can take many different forms. Some examples include: shooting or bombarding a judge or prosecutor as they leave work or court; poisoning or smothering a judge or prosecutor in their sleep; rigging trials against the victim; or kidnapping and torturing the victim in order to extract information about their investigation into political corruption.

Judicial murder is a serious threat to the integrity of the justice system and the rule of law.

Since 2000, he has been a Paul and Jean Hanna Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, an American public policy think tank located at Stanford University in California. He was awarded the Yidan Prize for Education Research in 2021. Hanushek advocates using economic analysis to improve student performance. He has authored numerous, highly cited articles on the effects of class size reduction, high-stakes accountability, teacher effectiveness, and other education related topics.   In a 1971 paper he introduced the concept of evaluating teacher effectiveness on the basis of student learning gains. This idea is the basis of value-added assessments of teacher quality. In his most recent book, The Knowledge Capital of Nations, Hanushek concludes that the quality of education is causally related to economic growth.","Eric Alan Hanushek (; born May 22, 1950) is an American economist who has made significant contributions to the field of education and economic research.

Hanushek has written extensively on economics, education, and policy issues. He is best known for his work in labor economics, which has focused on the determinants of wages and employment in both the United States and other countries. His most influential work has demonstrated that while there are many factors that determine wages and employment levels, human capital (i.e., skills) is a dominant determinant of wage levels. Furthermore, Hanushek has demonstrated that while government intervention can improve employment opportunities and wages for low-income groups, it typically does not have a large impact on the wages or employment levels of high-income individuals or groups.

As currently circumscribed, the family contains 33 genera and about 700 species. The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species). Taxonomy 
The Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved. Based on morphological grounds and supported by molecular studies, the American species traditionally identified as Capparis have been transferred to resurrected generic names. Several new genera have also been recently described.","The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as capers, is a family of flowering plants in the order Capitatae. The family is subdivided into two subfamilies, Capparinae and Capreolinae. There are about 165 genera and 2,000 species of capers, distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical climates.

The capers are a terrestrial or semiterrestrial family of flowering plants. They are herbs or small shrubs, with fleshy leaves that are either alternate or opposite and entire or toothed. The flowers are arranged in spikelike inflorescences, each with a few small sepals and petals. The fruit is a tiny Capsicum, typically a pepper but sometimes a fruit that resembles a tomato. The genus Capparis contains the typical capers (Capparis spinosa) and the related genus Ceratonia contains the false capers (Ceratonia siliqua), which have edible fruits resembling those of the true capers.

The series focuses on a young boy named Todd Casil, otherwise known as Squee. An introverted and bullied little kid with a less than supportive family, Squee has been forced to mature a bit more quickly than his peers. He is fond of writing, but only receives criticism from his teacher and taunting from his classmates. Any attempts he makes to deflect these hostilities only results in being shoved into the dirt or otherwise further humiliated. Squee's mother is addicted to some form of pill and spends a lot of time lying around in a nearly incoherent state. She often forgets who Squee is, or that she even has a child. His father, painfully aware of Squee's existence, loathes the boy and never forgets to mention that he blames Squee for ""ruining"" his life, claiming that he ""hasn't smiled once since [Squee] was born"".

In 1967 he suffered a nervous breakdown and retreated to his home village of Solva (in Pembrokeshire) to recuperate, and started to write songs in Welsh in a concerted effort to create a distinctive national pop music. From 1967 to 1969 he recorded a series of now rare Welsh-language picture sleeve EPs (Mike Stevens, Rhif 2 (Number 2), Mwg (Smoke), Y Brawd Houdini (Houdini's Brother), Meic Stevens, Diolch yn Fawr (Many Thanks), Byw yn y Wlad (Living in the Country)). These were made for local labels like Sain and Wren, for whom he was one of the first artistes to record. He also performed around Britain during the '60s, playing on recording sessions (notably for his friend Gary Farr's debut album on the Marmalade label). He made a one-off English language LP, Outlander, for Warner Bros. Records in 1970, but the contract was abandoned by mutual consent.

The grey-fronted honeyeater was originally described in 1841 by English ornithologist John Gould as Lichenostomus plumulus. It was moved to the genus Ptilotula after a molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2011, showed that Lichenostomus was polyphyletic. Description
The grey-fronted honeyeater is a small, plain honeyeater with a yellow neck plume bordered above by black. It has a small grey patch at the forehead, that may be obscure in northern subspecies. The crown is olive yellow and the lores blackish. The upper parts are olive grey and flight feathers yellow olive. Underparts are off white with indistinct stripes. The grey-fronted honeyeater can easily be confused with the yellow-tinted honeyeater as their ranges overlap and they are of similar size. Differences include the lores which are yellow grey and plumes that are narrower in the yellow-tinted honeyeater.","The grey-fronted honeyeater (Ptilotula plumula) is a passerine bird of the honeyeater family, which contains five genera and over a hundred species.

In the US, hypoglycemia is when the blood glucose level is below 30 mg/dl within the first 24 hours of life and below 45 mg/dl thereafter. In the UK, however, lower and more variable thresholds are used (<18 mg/dl at any time OR baby with abnormal clinical signs and a single value <45 mg/dl OR baby at risk of impaired metabolic adaptation but without abnormal clinical signs and a measurement <36 mg/dl and remaining <36 mg/dl at next measurement).

There are known risk factors that can be both maternal and neonatal. This is a treatable condition. Its treatment depends on the cause of the hypoglycemia. Though it is treatable, it can be fatal if gone undetected.  Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem in newborns.

A two-year demonstration library system, the Timberland Library Demonstration (TLD), was established in 1964 to serve Grays Harbor, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, and Thurston counties, using $310,000 in funds from the federal Library Services and Construction Act and local sources. Each of the counties had cities with independent library systems and several rural library districts, including the Grays Harbor County Rural Library District and South Puget Sound Regional Library, who chose to either join or opt out of the demonstration project. The Timberland Library Demonstration relied on the Washington State Library to process its books, which were also stored in municipal libraries. The system debuted its bookmobile in September 1964, based in Centralia and traveling on ten routes between rural areas in all five counties. The formation of a permanent library district would require a public vote, which was pushed back from 1966 to 1968, waiting for a more favorable general election.

It is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology laboratories. It was the third endonuclease to be isolated from the Haemophilus aegyptius bacteria. The enzyme's recognition site—the place where it cuts DNA molecules—is the GGCC nucleotide sequence which means it cleaves DNA at the site 5′-GG/CC-3. The recognition site is usually around 4-8 bps.This enzyme's gene has been sequenced and cloned. This is done to make DNA fragments in blunt ends. HaeIII is not effective for single stranded DNA cleavage. Properties
HaeIII has a molecular weight of 37126. After a 2-10-fold of HaeIII takes place, there is overdigestion of a DNA substrate. This results in 100% being cut, more than 50% of fragments being ligated, and more than 95% being recut. Heat inactivation comes at about 80 °C for 20 minutes. The locus of the HaeIII enzyme is on AF05137, and is linear with 957 base pairs.","HaeIII is one of many restriction enzymes that can cleave a variety of nucleic acids. This enzyme is found in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells and catalyzes the hydrolysis of adenine, guanine, and cytosine to uracil and thymine, respectively.

As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls, exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more and more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries. Historically, competitive devaluations have been rare as countries have generally preferred to maintain a high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war broke out in the 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.","Currency war, also known as competitive devaluations, is a situation in which two or more countries attempt to lower the value of their currencies to gain an advantage in exports over their rivals.

Although thought to be an early Christian, Sebastian is a worshipper of the Roman sun god Phoebus Apollo and sublimates his desire for his male companions into worship of his deity and pacifism. Both incense Severus, the commanding officer of the garrison, who becomes increasingly obsessed with Sebastian, tries to assault him, and ultimately presides over his summary execution for refusing to take up arms in defence of the Roman Empire. Justin, one of his comrades in arms, is also in love with Sebastian, albeit necessarily unrequited, but he forms a friendship with the stubborn celibate pacifist. Adrian and Anthony, two of Sebastian's fellow soldiers, are gay and in obvious love with one another.","Sebastiane is a 1976 Latin-language British historical drama film directed by Peter Medak and starring Mandy Patinkin and John Gielgud.

Extra material such as horn nocks on the ends, or built-up handles, would normally be accepted as part of a self bow. Some modern authorities would also accept a bow spliced together in the handle from two pieces of wood. Comparison with composite bows 
An effective self bow can be made from widely available local material in most inhabited parts of the world, with limited tools whose functions include chopping, shaving, and scraping. A day of work may be needed, starting with a seasoned stave; a composite bow requires a week's work, and could possibly take up to several years, starting with a much greater range of materials and skills. Self bows must be approximately the height of the archer if they are to allow a long draw, and they are less efficient in the specialized art of flight archery.  Well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight give higher arrow velocity, and the bow itself is shorter. However, the hide glue that holds a composite bow together absorbs water and will dissolve if soaked; the wood of self bows is less sensitive to humidity. ","A self bow or simple bow is a bow made from a single piece of wood. It is the simplest type of bow, and is often used as a starting point for more advanced bows.",2,201,35,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Self bow'

463144,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactionism,Interactionism,"In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.","In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that emphasizes the role of social interaction in human behaviour.

61065834,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldsmith%20banker,Goldsmith banker,"A  goldsmith banker was a business role that emerged in seventeenth century London from the London goldsmiths where they gradually expanded their services to include storage of wealth, providing loans, transferring money and providing bills of exchange that would lead to the development of cheques.  Some of the concepts were brought over from Amsterdam where goldsmiths would provide gold storage and issue chits that started to be used as a means of exchange.  The goldsmith banker became a key development in the history of banking that would lead to modern banking. History
Their emergence was gradual: exchanging goldsmiths, who dealt in coinage, started to become recognised as carrying out a different activity from a working goldsmith in the 1630s. Prior to that date banking in London was principally carried out by foreigners, generally Italians, Germans, and the Dutch. However this innovation led to an indigenous banking tradition. The seizure of the mint by Charles I in 1640 created anxiety about the safe storage of valuables, which was further increased during the English Civil War, which also disrupted the regular work of the working goldsmiths. They soon developed accountancy practices to keep track of deposits. Then they also started paying interest on deposits so they could loan out increasing quantities of gold. The depositor was given a receipt with their name and the amount of the deposit. Such receipts became negotiable and thus evolved into the bank note.",A  goldsmith banker was a businessperson who acted as banker for goldsmiths.

With its headquarters at Atlantic Road, Brixton (and later at Waterloo Road, London) and grocery shops across southern England, it was a rival to the Sainsbury's chain, John and Mary Sainsbury having opened their first grocery shop in Holborn one year earlier. A deep personal rivalry developed between the two families, because of acrimonious feelings about the Greigs' alleged betrayal of a verbal agreement regarding the purchasing of sites for development. The David Greig chain is considered to have been established in 1870, when the wife of a Hornsey cabinet maker of Scots birth opened a small provisions shop at 32 High Street, Hornsey. By 1881 her son David Greig had joined her in the business and described himself as a 'provision dealer' in the census of that year. The business thrived and wishing to expand beyond Hornsey, Greig opened his first shop at 54-58 Atlantic Road, Brixton in 1888, initially ""anchoring"" the nascent Brixton Market, which started in Atlantic Road in the 1870s and was so successful that it spread to Brixton Road before being relocated to Brixton Station Road plus several purpose built covered arcades and finally also Electric Avenue, to reduce congestion and allow further growth. Around 1890 a second shop was opened at nearby Loughborough Junction, near Brixton. This was probably the shop at 232 Coldharbour Lane where a wooden ‘David Greig’ fascia with ‘Brilliant cut’ gilded lettering in the distinctive serif typeface of the chain, was uncovered in 2020.

In contrast to their debut album Suede, which exhibited the influences of David Bowie and the Smiths, Dog Man Star exhibits a more varied aesthetic and draws from a wider range of influences. Although it did not sell on the same scale as its predecessor, it reached number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified as gold by the BPI in November 1994. Described by Rolling Stone as ""one of the most pretentious albums ever released by a major label,"" the record was released in a different UK musical climate to their hitherto discography. Out-of-step with the mainstream music scene, it featured the band diverting away from the ""Britpop pack"" of bands.","Dog Man Star is the second album by American rock band the Darkness, released in 1982.

The Darkness emerged from the ashes of the pioneering Detroit heavy metal band Death, founded by guitarist and songwriter Rob Halford.

However, after subsequent releases failed to achieve the same level of success, the Darkness disbanded in 1986.

Five years later, in 1991, Halford reformed the band with new members and recorded Dog Man Star.

In 1986, David Rohl proposed that there were two king Shoshenqs bearing the prenomen Hedjkheperre – (i) the well-known founder of the dynasty, Hedjkheperre Shoshenq I, and (ii) a later pharaoh from the second half of the dynasty, whom Rohl called Hedjkheperre Shoshenq (b) due to his exact position in the dynasty being unknown. Following Rohl's proposal (first suggested to him by Pieter Gert van der Veen in 1984), the British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson supported the new king's existence by demonstrating that the earlier Hedjkheperre Shoshenq bore simple epithets in his titulary, whereas the later Hedjkheperre Shoshenq's epithets were more complex. Dodson suggested that the ruler that Kenneth Kitchen, in his standard work on Third Intermediate Period chronology, had numbered Shoshenq IV – bearing the prenomen Usermaatre – should be removed from the 22nd Dynasty and replaced by Rohl's Hedjkheperre Shoshenq (b), renumbering the latter as Shoshenq IV. At the same time the old Usermaatre Shoshenq IV was renumbered as Shoshenq VI. Dodson's historical summary of the new King Shoshenq IV's discovery and his supportive evidence for that king's independent existence from Hedjkheperre Shoshenq I appeared in an article entitled ‘A New King Shoshenq Confirmed?’ in 1993.","Hedjkheperre Setepenre Shoshenq IV was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the Twenty-second Dynasty.

It was celebrated on the 19th day of the month of Thargelion (late May, in the Gregorian calendar), and was introduced in 429 BC.  The festival took place in the Piraeus.  It was rare for ancient Athens to permit foreign residents of the city to worship their own gods; the cult of Bendis and the Bendidia is one of a few exceptions, driven by the strategic importance of Thrace to Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. The Bendidia began with a procession to the sanctuary of Bendis.  Worshippers coming from Athens processed from the Prytaneion, while the Thracian worshippers of Bendis in the Piraeus organised a separate procession, possibly organised so that it would join up with the Athenian contingent before they arrived at the sanctuary.  The procession from Athens – six miles from the sanctuary – was provided with sponges and basins in which to wash, and garlands; the celebrants then ate lunch in the precinct of the sanctuary.  After dark, there was a horseback relay race, with the riders passing torches.  The horseback race was a Thracian feature of the festival, as such races at Athenian festivals were usually performed on foot, and Thracians were famous for their equestrianism, though it is unknown if similar races were also held in Thrace itself.  The horse race was followed by an all-night celebration, though the precise details of the remainder of the festival are unknown.","The Bendidia was an ancient Athenian festival in honour of Bendis, the goddess of fortune. celebrants would dip an olive into the sea and carry it to the Acropolis, where they would place it on a statue of Bendis.

The route begins in downtown West Chester and heads east out of the borough as a one-way pair of streets. Between West Chester and Upper Darby, PA 3 follows a four-lane divided highway named West Chester Pike through suburban areas. Along this stretch, the route passes through Edgmont, Newtown Square, Broomall, and Havertown. The route has an interchange with Interstate 476 (I-476) between Broomall and Havertown. Upon reaching Upper Darby, PA 3 heads into Philadelphia along Market Street. In Philadelphia, the route follows multiple one-way pairs, running along Chestnut Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound in West Philadelphia before heading into Center City Philadelphia along Market Street eastbound and John F. Kennedy Boulevard westbound and ending at Philadelphia City Hall. Philadelphia and West Chester were linked by a dirt road dating back to 1793. The Philadelphia and West Chester Turnpike Company was created to build a toll road between the two places in 1848. The turnpike was built as a plank road between Philadelphia and Newtown Square in the 1850s before becoming a stone road in the 1880s. A horse-drawn rail line was built along part of the turnpike in the 1850s and a trolley service was introduced in the 1890s. The state took over the West Chester Pike in 1918. In 1927, the route was designated as part of PA 5. PA 3 replaced the PA 5 designation between West Chester and Philadelphia in 1937. Trolley service was replaced by buses in the 1950s to allow for the widening of PA 3 between West Chester and Philadelphia to four lanes.

Meliga succeeded his elder brother Mandalika II in 1400 CE. His father Mokalasimha had to move the capital from Junagadh to Vanthali due to order from the Governor of Gujarat Zafar Khan on behalf of Delhi Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq who placed a thanadar. It seems that Meliga had played no role when Zafar Khan attacked Somnath temple in 1402 CE which was under repair. Meliga expelled the thanadar from Junagadh and again made it his capital. According to the Mandalika Kavya, he had sheltered a Jhala chieftain (probably Satarsal) fleeing from Gujarat Sultan Ahmad Shah I. Mirat-i-Sikandari tells that, in 1413-14 CE, Ahmad Shah marched against Junagadh. On this occasion, Melinga fought a pitched battle with Ahmad Shah at Vanthali but was defeated and fled to Junagadh. Vanthali was taken by Ahmad Shah who then marched to Junagadh and took the lower fortress (the Uparkot but the Raja escaped by fleeing to the upper fortress of Girnar. But the Mirat-i-Sikandri adds, 'The greater part of the zamindars of Sorath became submissive and obedient and consented to service.' Ahmad Shah left two officers,  Sayad Ábûl Khair and Sayad Kásim, were left to collect the zamindar'''s tribute, salami and returned to his capital, Ahmedabad. The inscriptions (VS 1469/1413 CE) on five paliyas (memorial stones) of people died in battle at Vanthali corroborate this event.

Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford initially disliked the song and declined to record it for that album. Instead the group chose an instrumental improvisation as the title track. However, ""Starless"" was later revived, its lyrics altered and a long instrumental section (based on a bass riff written by Bruford) added to it, and performed live between March and June 1974. For the Red recording sessions, the lyrics were again altered (with contributions by Richard Palmer-James). The introductory theme, originally played by David Cross, was taken over by the guitar, with Fripp making minor alterations to the melody.

The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story.  The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity. The main characters often have comical idiosyncrasies and the law enforcement individuals are characterized by ineptitude or inadequacies. The criminals comically plan a crime with details unnecessary for the nature of the crime and humour is created when their personalities clash and their quirks are exposed.  For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters — in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property.  By contrast, the same author's Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime — the criminal equivalent of the police procedural. Others, such as Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of burglar Rhodenbarr's criminal talents to solve murders.","The caper story is a subgenre of the detective story.

Vitamin E deficiency, which is rare and usually due to an underlying problem with digesting dietary fat rather than from a diet low in vitamin E, can cause nerve problems. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant which may help protect cell membranes from reactive oxygen species. Worldwide, government organizations recommend adults consume in the range of 3 to 15 mg per day. As of 2016, consumption was below recommendations according to a worldwide summary of more than one hundred studies that reported a median dietary intake of 6.2 mg per day for alpha-tocopherol. Research with alpha-tocopherol as a dietary supplement, with daily amounts as high as 2,000 mg per day, has had mixed results. Population studies suggested that people who consumed foods with more vitamin E, or who chose on their own to consume a vitamin E dietary supplement, had lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dementia, and other diseases, but placebo-controlled clinical trials could not always replicate these findings. As of 2017, vitamin E continues to be a topic of active clinical research. There is no clinical evidence that use of vitamin E skincare products are effective.

970950,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global%20aphasia,Global aphasia,"Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.","Global aphasia is a severe form of aphasia that affects all languages, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in producing spoken words and understanding spoken language.

Humanity may have been descended from them, or they may be a different fictional race, such as elves, dwarves, or aliens. While in some cases, whether they currently exist is unclear, in other instances, members of an elder race still inhabit the world, either openly or in secret. In order to hide their existence, they may make use of a wainscot society, inhabit a parallel universe, only visiting the current one occasionally, or disguise themselves as a fool, deity, magician or trickster. One such example is in Lord of Light (1967), where highly advanced humans take on the identities of Hindu deities and act as gods to the less advanced colonists. Elder races are typically either technologically or spiritually powerful, as well as wise. While sometimes benevolent, assisting younger races, they can also often be amoral, as in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, where the Elder Gods are indifferent to humanity's ""petty"" concerns. They are usually presented as having drifted apart from humanity in the present of the story, sometimes as lost empires whose inhabitants either left their former home for a new one, or were destroyed by a catastrophe and only live on in legend, such as Atlantis. They may appear both as enemies, or as allies against a greater threat.","An elder or progenitor race, in science fiction, is a hypothetical intelligent species older than humanity.

68370026,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy%20value,Epoxy value,"Epoxy value derives from the Epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) or Weight Per Epoxide (WPE) and is a measure of the epoxy content of an epoxy resin or epoxy functional diluent. This is an important parameter as it allows determination of the correct mix ratio of an epoxy system with a curing agent. The epoxide equivalent weight is usually measured first and done by titration. The standard test method is ASTM D1652 though this has been modified by certain states of the USA. The epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) maybe defined as: the number of grams of epoxy resin required to give 1 mole of epoxy groups. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. Example calculations 
Polyoxypropylene diglycidyl ether a  reactive diluent with the trade name of Diluent F has an average molecular weight of 1000 and a functionality of 2 so the EEW is 1000/2 = 500.The epoxy group content (EGC) is a term which arises from the EEW and is usually found in the literature with units of m.mol/kg. So from the units it can be deduced that an epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 as above, has an epoxy group content of 1000000/191 = 5236 m.mol/kg. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. So as an example using the epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 and a molar mass of 382, the epoxy value is calculated as follows: 382g gives 2 moles of epoxy groups and therefore 100g = 100/382 x 2 = 0.53  i.e. the epoxy value of the resin is 0.53.","Epoxy value derives from the Epoxy equivalent weight (EW) of a resin. The EW is a measure of the weight of a resin in terms of an equivalent volume of pure epoxy.

Epoxy resins are generally classified according to their curing method, which affects their epoxy value. Two curing methods are direct cure and indirect cure. Direct cure epoxy resins have a higher epoxy value than indirect cure resins because they require less curing time.",2,276,74,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Epoxy value'

The core of an economy is a concept from cooperative game theory defined as the set of feasible allocations in an economy that cannot be improved upon by subset of the set of the economy's consumers (a coalition). For general equilibrium economies typically the core is non-empty (there is at least one feasible allocation) but also ""large"" in the sense that there may be a continuum of feasible allocations that satisfy the requirements. The conjecture basically states that if the number of agents is also ""large"" then the only allocations in the core are precisely what a competitive market would produce. As such, the conjecture is seen as providing some game-theoretic foundations for the usual assumption in general equilibrium theory of price taking agents. In particular, it means that in a ""large"" economy people act as if they were price takers, even though theoretically they have all the power to set prices and renegotiate their trades. Hence, the fictitious Walrasian auctioneer of general equilibrium, while strictly speaking completely unrealistic, can be seen as a ""short-cut"" to getting the right answer.","In economics, the Edgeworth conjecture is the assertion that any two interacting agents who each have information about the other's choices can always agree on a mutually beneficial exchange. Named after Francis Edgeworth, the conjecture is also known as the Edgeworth–Kuhn–Tucker theorem.

The order is thought to have diverged from the ancestral marsupial line very early. They were once included in the superorder but it is now known that Ameridelphia is paraphyletic, having given rise to Australidelphia, and thus could be considered an evolutionary grade. Genetic studies indicate that they are the second most basal order of marsupials, after the didelphimorphs. As recently as 20 million years ago, at least seven genera were in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the High Andes. Shrews were entirely absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are currently present only in the northwestern part of the continent. Traditionally, it was thought that shrew opossums lost ground to these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Evidence suggests, however, that both groups not only overlap, but do not seem to be in direct competition, and the marsupials' larger size seems to imply that they prey on shrews and rodents. Several opossums, such as Monodelphis, also occupy small insectivore niches.","The family Caenolestidae contains the seven surviving species of shrew opossums. The shrew opossum is the only species endemic to North America. It is the only mammal in the family that is considered to be a marsupial. Like other opossums, the shrew opossum has a prehensile tail that it uses for balance and for manipulating objects.

The shrew opossum was once abundant in North America but its population has decreased by more than 90% since the 1960s.

It appears that the site was entirely abandoned by the end of the Late Preclassic (ca. A.D. 250).

Its name Picu Urriellu is believed to be derived from the term Los Urrieles, which is used to describe the Macizo Central. Naranjo de Bulnes is part of the Cabrales region of Asturias, and lies within the Picos de Europa National Park. The first written reference to ""Picu Urriellu"" as ""Naranjo de Bulnes"" is credited to the German geologist and engineer, Wilhelm Schulz, who, in 1855, published the first topographic and geological map of Asturias. As far as is known the etymology of this name is not clear, because, historically, the local inhabitants always referred to the mountain as ""Picu Urriellu"". It has been suggested that the name can be attributed to the orange hue of the limestone from which the peak is formed. The local residents of Bulnes have a saying concerning the contentious name: ""No me llameis Naranjo, pues fruto no puedo dar, llamadme Picu Urriellu que es mi nombre natural"".

Older potential avialans have since been identified, including Anchiornis, Xiaotingia, and Aurornis.

Similar in size to a Eurasian magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, the largest species of Archaeopteryx could grow to about  in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx had more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than with modern birds. In particular, they shared the following features with the dromaeosaurids and troodontids: jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes (""killing claw""), feathers (which also suggest warm-bloodedness), and various features of the skeleton.","Archaeopteryx , sometimes referred to by its nickname ""the flying bird"", is an extinct genus of bird that lived during the late Jurassic period.

In print from 1883 to 1909, and published in Beatrice and in Washington, D.C., the newspaper connected radical feminism with women's culture on the Midwestern frontier. Throughout its run, its slogan was ""Equality Before the Law.""  Unlike other suffrage papers that focused on urban culture and politics, The Woman's Tribune'''s appeal to the rural and everyday woman made it one of the most powerful voices of feminist ideology during its day. Colby routinely included generalist news, suffrage news, book reviews, travelogues, editorials, and even poetry in the paper. Some stories and features were intended to be read to children, presumably by their mothers, making the Tribune unusual in its explicitly multi-generational audience. Despite lack of financial support from national suffrage organizations, Colby managed to keep the Tribune in production for its 26 years; she wrote, edited, copyedited, and even at times typeset the paper. Advertising focused on products and services provided by and for women. Notices of events in the international suffragist community appeared as well, connecting women on the American frontier to women's suffrage campaigns in Europe and Asia. Colby met and corresponded with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; she frequently published their work in the Tribune although she received little, if any, financial support from their political orgazniation. Bloomberg has argued that the Woman's Tribune'' was unique among women's suffrage publications in that it argued for full equality under the law for Native and indigenous people (women and men); the core audience of the paper, however, like its founding editor, was in the white, literate middle-class.

Its ocean beach (which is not patrolled) is also popular with surfers and divers. Its local government area is the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. Rye is in the traditional country of the Boon wurrung (Bunurong) people of the Kulin nation. History
Rye was proclaimed a town on 26 February 1861 and is partly in the parish of Wannaeue but mainly in the parish of Nepean, which is west of Government Road and Weeroona Street. The township went south to the southern boundary of the cemetery, with its east and west boundaries being Weir Street and Dundas Street. Suburban lots of 21 to 98 acres extended west to French St and south to a point just past the Golf Pde corner. Most of these suburban lots were bought by W.A.Blair, a Melbourne Lime Merchant.
He also received grants for much land in the parishes of Wannaeue and Nepean. His objective was to establish a monopoly, which was only rivalled by John Cain. Many who had been engaged in the production of lime, such as Nathan Page, Tom Bennett, Edward Russell, Harold Bainbridge and Spunner, were dispossessed of their kilns by Blair in about 1867. Lime could be quarried throughout the area west of Boneo Road. Many golf courses and the Peninsula Hot Springs are on the sites of Limeburners' properties between Browns and Limestone Roads. An excellent reproduction of a lime kiln can be seen on the foreshore just east of White Cliff. They were built into the side of a hill so that firewood and napped limestone could be loaded from above.","Rye is a seaside town in Greater Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

The painting features several small details and disguised symbolism that may go unnoticed to the common eye, but nevertheless contribute to the painting's meaning. Visual Analysis 
This painting is a visual representation of medical practices that were performed on women in the 1660s. Jan Steen uses very direct facial expressions to show what the people in this painting were feeling. Women in paintings such as this and The Lovesick Maiden  are usually young, pretty and well dressed, while being positioned upward in a chair. The facial expressions in these paintings often had a vacant and senseless look while the doctor takes the woman's pulse. In other similar examples, the doctor may also be looking at the urine sample that an assistant holds up to the light.  The backgrounds of these paintings tend to have elegant paintings on the walls..The woman sitting down on the right is suffering from illness, which during the time was not only hard to identify, but also extremely difficult to treat. Paintings consistently represent women in a fragile, passive, housebound way which was much more of a  male wish, rather than a female reality. Women in these paintings are often presented to be weak, and surrounded by concerned family members.","The Physician's Visit is a 1660-1662 oil on canvas painting by Johannes Vermeer.

Born in Dublin, Ireland, Barker had an erratic education but excelled in mathematics, becoming keen on electronics. He is best known for his ground-breaking work on synchronising digital communication systems and framing of received data, using digital codes (see frame slip). These digital codes are known as Barker code. The method was initially researched at SRDE Royal Signals Research Establishment, just after World War II for use in radar, rocket telemetry and digital speech. In 1952, Barker found 7 Barker sequences up to a length of 13 useful for correlation. These sequences are widely used in most data transmissions today. Examples of applications are radar, mobile phone technology, telemetry, digital speech, ultrasound imaging and testing, GPS and Wi-Fi, etc. Early career","Ronald Hugh Barker FIEE (19157 October 2015) was a British mathematician who made significant contributions to the theory of operator algebras, functional analysis and operator theory, as well as to the mathematical theory of probability and combinatorics.

The viola and other string instruments were brought during the Portuguese maritime expansion to the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde, Brazil and other locales, becoming common in the populations. Due to its importance in Portuguese music it likely arrived in Angola, Goa and Macau, and as far as Hawaii by the 19th century, where it became the forerunner of the ukulele. These early cordophones, the violas, had characteristics identical to the modern instruments, and great importance along the Iberian Peninsula, where it appeared in iconography, poems and diverse literature. The chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso, who identified it as just a ""Viola"", suggested that it first arrived in the Azores in the second half of the 19th century, brought the first settlers.

The name ""viola da Terceira"" was introduced in the 18th century. The viola da Terceira is commonly used in classical music, chamber music and as a solo instrument.

The lowest string is G, the next D, then A, followed by E and finally G. This configuration gives it a brighter sound than the violin and enables it to be played more easily in higher positions on the keyboard.

The viola da Terceira was first constructed around 1550 by Antonio Stradivari and his sons Giuseppe and Antonio. It became one of Stradivari's most popular and renowned instruments, and many of his violas are still extant.

The skin is cleaned, draped, and anesthetized if time allows. The greater saphenous vein is identified on the surface above the medial malleolus, a full-thickness transverse skin incision is made, and 2 cm of the vein is freed from the surrounding structures. The vessel is tied closed distally, the proximal portion is transected (venotomy) and gently dilated, and a cannula is introduced through the venotomy and secured in place with a more proximal ligature around the vein and cannula.

The instrumentation for a brass quintet typically includes two trumpets or cornets, one French horn, one trombone or euphonium/baritone horn, and one tuba or bass trombone. Musicians in a brass quintet may often play multiple instruments. Trumpet players for instance may double on piccolo trumpets and flugelhorns. There can be variation in instrumentation depending on the type of quintet. In some quintets, the horn is replaced by an additional trombone. Euphonium may also be substituted for the trombone part. While the tuba is considered a standard, the range and style of many pieces lend themselves to being played with bass trombone as the lowest-pitched instrument. Additionally, some pieces call for the use of percussion instruments, particularly the snare drum, tambourine, or timpani. History 
The earliest brass chamber music was written in the mid to late 1800s and coincided with the invention of brass instruments that could play chromatically. The Distin family formed one of the first brass quintets in 1833, touring Europe and the United States to promote a new family of brass instruments called saxhorns.

Bellon published the first series of twelve brass quintets in 1850 while Ewald composed his quintets between the years 1888 and 1912 all while improvements were being made to brass instruments. The improvement of brass instruments played a big role later on in the history of brass quintets as it allowed the player to do more with the instrument which in turn allowed for more artistry.

He studied botany at the University of Copenhagen from 1911 under the professors Eugenius Warming, Christen C. Raunkiær, L. Kolderup Rosenvinge og W. Johannsen. He took his Ph.D. from the same university in 1930. From 1934 to 1960, he was superintendent at the Botanical Museum of the University of Copenhagen. Hagerup’s scientific works concern evolution, polyploidy and pollination, among other things. He showed that the tetraploid Empetrum hermaphroditum is a separate species from the diploid Empetrum nigrum. He thereby initiated the use of chromosome numbers in systematic botany, a field later known as cytotaxonomy. He put forward the hypothesis that the ploidy level is an important factor in the distribution and ecology of plant species. In contrast, another of his scientific ideas has been disproven by later modern research – the idea of a direct ancestry of the centrosperms (approximately equal to Caryophyllales) from the gymnospermous Gnetophyta and, hence, two separate evolutionary lineages within the flowering plants. Many of Hagerup’s studies were concerned with plant species of the Ericaceae, Empetraceae and related families, or ’’Bicornes’’ as they were known in the Wettstein system.","Olaf Hagerup (29 September 1889 – 2 December 1975) was a Norwegian jurist and politician.

The Ki-87 was developed in response to American B-29 Superfortress raids on the Home Islands. It followed up on earlier research by Nakajima and the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters into boosting a large radial engine with an exhaust-driven turbo-supercharger, which had begun in 1942, well before the B-29 raids began. The efforts of the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters eventually culminated into the Tachikawa Ki-94-I, while the Ki-87 was developed as a fall-back project, using less stringent requirements. Nakajima started in July 1943 with the construction of three prototypes, to be completed between November 1944 and January 1945, and seven pre-production aircraft, to be delivered by April 1945. The Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters made itself felt during the development of the Ki-87 prototype when they insisted upon placing the turbo-supercharger in the rear-fuselage, and from the sixth prototype the Nakajima fighter was to have that arrangement. The Ki-87 had a rearward folding undercarriage to accommodate the storage of ammunition for the cannons, which were mounted in the wing.","The Nakajima Ki-87 was a Japanese high-altitude bomber that served with the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II.

Originally, an accessus was the introduction at the beginning of a commentary on a classical author, containing background information on the author and his work. Beginning in the 12th century, these accessus were excerpted from the commentaries and published in separate collections. It is to these collections that modern scholars give the name accessus ad auctores. Invariably written in Latin, they were designed for the use of students of Latin grammar. The standard accessus was arranged as a series of questions in the form headings followed by their answers. Four distinct schemes of organization are recognized based on the choice of headings:
The Servian sheme is based on the prologue to Virgil's Aeneid written by the 4th-century grammarian Servius. It covers seven headings: (1) the life of the poet, (2) the title of the work, (3) its genre, (4) authorial intention, (5) the number of volumes, (6) the order of the volumes and (7) an explanation or interpretation.
The rhetorical scheme is based on the septem circumstantiae (seven circumstances) of classical rhetoric: (1) who, (2) what, (3) where, (4) by what means, (5) why, (6) how and (7) when. It was favoured, for example, by the 9th-century commentator Remigius of Auxerre.
The philosophical scheme is based on Boethius' introduction to his own commentary on the Isagoge of Porphyry. It covers six headings: (1) the intention of the work, (2) its utility, (3) its internal order, (4) the name of the author, (5) the title of the work and (6) the branch of philosophy to which it belongs.
The modern scheme represents a conscious break with those that came before. It was a simplified form of the philosophical scheme and was favoured by 12th-century modernists like Conrad of Hirsau. It used three or four headings: (1) the subject matter, (2) authorial intention, (3) the utility of the work and (4) the branch of philosophy to which it belongs. Utility was sometimes dropped.","The accessus ad auctores ('introduction to authors') is a scholarly article written in Latin by a scholar in their field, typically a professor or researcher.

Very little is known about him. Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern Nanchang. The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the Zutang ji (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher Yunju Daoying. The Zutang ji does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. He is first explicitly mentioned in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples. The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that Tongan Guanzhi is Tongan Daopi's successor. However, this comes from Huihong's Sengbao zhuan, which was completed in 1119, much longer after Tongan's death than the other works. The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a Tongan Wei, in turn a student of Jufeng Puman, with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie. Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp, and neither with much information. However, Dayang Jingxuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage. This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted.

Coombs is home to approximately 1,327 people and is renowned for its Old Country Market (which features a family of goats living on the roof), Butterfly World (which includes a small indoor tropical rainforest), the 106 year old Coombs Fall Fair and the Coombs Bluegrass Festival held every B.C. Day weekend.
The history of Coombs goes back many years. The Ford House which is the old log house situated on the Alberni Highway is dated back to the early 1900s. The pioneer Walter Ford house was completed in 1911. Next to the Ford House is the old General Store which also always housed the General Post Office. 
The Coombs Fair Grounds is an active place throughout the year. 
The Rodeo Grounds just up the highway heading towards Port Alberni is a successful and active place during the summer months. The railway line is also a huge part of the history of Coombs. Along with the United Church and just over the French Creek Bridge is the French Creek School, opened in 1912, which closed in 2015 but is used now as a Coombs Community Commons. French Creek school was a huge asset to the community for over 100 years. The community was established in 1910 under a Salvation Army emigration plan to relocate people from the crowded cities in Great Britain. This new town was named after Commissioner Thomas Bales Coombs, head of the Salvation Army movement in Canada in the early 1900s. Coombs was retiring in 1911 so the Salvation Army honored him by naming the new Vancouver Island colony after him. Unfortunately Commissioner Coombs never visited the Coombs Colony.","Coombs is a small community on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.

2022756,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited%20utterance,Excited utterance,"An excited utterance, in the law of evidence, is a statement made by a person in response to a startling or shocking event or condition. It is an unplanned reaction to a ""startling event"".  It is an exception to the hearsay rule.  The statement must be spontaneously made by the person (the declarant) while still under the stress of excitement from the event or condition.  The subject matter and content of the statement must ""relate to"" event or condition.  The statement could be a description or explanation (as required for present sense impression), or an opinion or inference.  Examples include: ""Look out! We're going to crash!"" or ""I think he's crazy.  He's shooting at us!""  The basis for this hearsay exception is the belief that a statement made under the stress is likely to be trustworthy and unlikely to be a premeditated falsehood.  Compared to present sense impression, excited utterance is broader in scope for permitting a longer time lapse between event and statement, and a wider range of content in the statement. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, an excited utterance is a hearsay exception, and is admissible to prove the truth of the statement itself (e.g., in the case of the first quotation above, to prove that the vehicle the declarant was riding in was, in fact, about to crash). To prove the truth of the statement means to persuade the finder of fact to believe the affirmative sense of the statement. ""Truth"" here does not mean truth from the subjective point of view of the declarant or from the objective point of view of a reasonably prudent person. It simply refers to the affirmative assertion of the statement.","An excited utterance, in the law of torts, is an expression of joy, excitement, or enthusiasm.

When someone expresses excitement or enthusiasm in a way that causes harm to another person, they may be liable for damages. This is because the excited utterance is a form of intentional interference with another's peace and enjoyment of life.",2,289,55,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Excited utterance'

Bartholomew was the son of George I Ghisi and Alice dalle Carceri. His father died at the Battle of the Cephissus against the Catalan Company in 1311. As Bartholomew was underage, his mother assumed the regency while he was still minor, until her own death two years later. By 11 June 1315, Bartholomew II Ghisi was in direct control of his domains. From his father, Bartholomew inherited the lordship of Tinos, Mykonos, and parts of Kea and Serifos in the Duchy of Naxos, and from his mother one of the triarchies of Euboea (according to Raymond-Joseph Loenertz the central triarchy of Chalkis), while his father's other possession by his first wife, the Barony of Chalandritsa in the Principality of Achaea, returned to a member of the Dramelay family, Nicholas of Dramelay.

The origins of the Quda'a are obscure, with the claims of medieval Arab genealogists being contradictory. Some claimed that Quda'a, the tribe's progenitor, was a son of Ma'add, thus making the tribe northern Arabians, or a descendant of Himyar (south Arabians), basing their claims on traditions and quotes attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Among these alleged utterances of Muhammad were that Ma'add's kunya was Abū Quḍāʿa (""Father of Quda'a"") or that he explicitly stated Quda'a was a descendant of Himyar. Some medieval traditions harmonized these seemingly contradictory claims by holding that Quda'a's mother was the wife of Malik ibn 'Amr ibn Murra ibn Malik ibn Himyar, and that she later wed Ma'add, bringing Quda'a with her; thus Quda'a became known as a son of Ma'add, albeit not a biological one. This tradition is espoused by Ibn Abd Rabbih, who further notes that ""Quda'a"" was an epithet meaning ""leopard"" and the progenitor's actual name was 'Amr. Other traditions hold that at the dawn of the Umayyad era, the tribes of Quda'an embraced their descent from Ma'add, but under political pressure and bribes from the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah, switched their traditional line of descent to Himyar; by doing so, they embraced a Southern Arabian identity in the historical division of Arab tribes along southern and northern lines.","Quda'a (/ALA-LC: Quḍāʿa) were a group of sedentary Arab nomads who inhabited the southern Syrian Desert during the pre-Islamic period.

After the expulsion of Gorgus's son Periander its government developed into a strong democracy.  The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the Epirus trade), and its consequent aversion to Corcyra (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the Battle of Sybota, which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and Corinth).","Ambracia (; , occasionally , Ampracia) was a town of ancient Phocaea, on the Bithynian coast opposite the mouth of the Maeander.

However, in 2007, vinyl sales made a sudden small increase, starting its comeback, and by the early 2010s, it was growing at a very quick rate. In some territories, vinyl is now more popular than it has been since the late 1980s, though vinyl records still make up only a marginal percentage (less than 6%) of overall music sales.","The vinyl revival, also known as the analog revival, is a resurgence of interest in vinyl records as a playback medium, mainly among audiophiles and music collectors.

The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as part of an anti-commercial and experimental or avant-garde movement of drama and theatre. Over time, some off-off-Broadway productions have moved away from the movement's early experimental spirit. History 
The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as a ""complete rejection of commercial theatre"".  Michael Smith gives credit for the term's coinage to Jerry Tallmer in 1960. Among the first venues for what would soon be called ""off-off-Broadway"" theatre were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, particularly the Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric Joe Cino, who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. This DIY aesthetic also led to creative acts of object repurposing by playwrights and directors, who cobbled together sets from materials scavenged from local streets. Also integral to the rise of off-off-Broadway were Ellen Stewart at La MaMa, and Al Carmines at Judson Poets Theatre, located at Judson Memorial Church. Other theaters of note that presented many plays were Theatre Genesis, New York Theatre Ensemble, The Old Reliable, The Dove Company, The Playwrights Workshop, and Workshop of the Players Art.","Off-off-Broadway theaters are smaller New York City theaters that are not affiliated with a major theater chain.

According to Professor Martin Shapiro of University of California, Berkeley, who first noted the theory in 1964: ""The core of  political jurisprudence is a vision of courts as political agencies and judges as political actors."" Legal decisions are no longer focused on a judge's analytical analysis (as in Analytical jurisprudence), but rather it is the judges themselves that become the focus for determining how the decision was reached. Political jurisprudence advocates that judges are not machines but are influenced and swayed by the political system and by their own personal beliefs of how the law should be decided. That is not to say necessarily that judges arbitrarily make decisions they personally feel should be right without regard to stare decisis. Instead they are making decisions based on their political, legal, and personal beliefs as it relates to the law. Deeply, and with more implication for the society, the decisions of the judges are not only modified from the politics, but modify itself the politics and the process of law making in a so influential way, that we can say that the policy-making is ""judicialized"". Shapiro noted political jurisprudence as having two wings, the macro wing and the micro wing. The macro wing looks at courts as players in the political process. In their processes of decision making, they entertain matters from different interest groups hence shape policy through pressure from these. the micro wing looks at individual decisions of judges. The second wing is a manifestation of Charles H. Pritchett who introduced behaviorism into USA judicial studies after studies that showed individual decisions in courts have been increasing since the days of President Roosevelt.","Political jurisprudence is a legal theory that deals with the interpretation and application of the law in relation to politics.

Political jurisprudence is a legal theory that deals with the interpretation and application of the law in relation to politics.

Political jurisprudence also considers how the law should be changed or adapted to meet the changing needs of political society.

One of the most important goals of political jurisprudence is to ensure that the law is applied equitably and fairly. This means that judges must take into account all relevant factors when ruling on cases, including the political context in which they arose, the interests of the parties involved, and the larger implications of the decision.

These skinks are ecologically diverse omnivores that inhabit a wide range of habitats. However, in the loose delimitation (which incorporates about 30 species) the genus is not monophyletic but an evolutionary grade, as has long been suspected due to its lack of characteristic apomorphies. Some of the skinks traditionally placed in Egernia appear to be among the most intelligent squamates. They have been shown to be able to distinguish between relatives and unrelated conspecifics, and can recognize relatives individually. Several species form monogamous pair-bonds. For instance, the Black Rock Skink is a species who can perform kin discrimination based on scent and form monogamous pair-bonds and a nuclear family structure. Most of these species belong to Egernia sensu stricto, and similar behaviour is also known in the related Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata). The latter means that the high intelligence and social skills are probably plesiomorphic for the Egernia genus-group as a whole, and that the solitary species appear to have evolved towards being less intelligent and social again.

A bedpan can be used for both urinary and fecal discharge. Many diseases can confine a patient to bed, necessitating the use of bedpans, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and dementia. Additionally, many patients may be confined to a bed temporarily as a result of a temporary illness, injury, or surgery. Bedpans are usually constructed of stainless steel, which is easy to clean and durable, but may be cold, hard, and uncomfortable to use.  Also, the supporting area of some products is very small, and prolonged use can cause pressure ulcers.

In 1889 the Tempelhof marshalling yard was built on the site and extended several times until the 1930s. A Bahnbetriebswerk was constructed in 1931. After the closure of the Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof in 1952 the western section of the marshalling yard was closed. Nature began reclaiming the disused yard and lines. However, the eastern half of the yard remained in use for limited shunting operation with the Bahnbetriebswerk continuing to be used by Deutsche Reichsbahn. During the late 1970s construction of a new freight station on the site was proposed; however these proposals met community resistance and were finally abandoned in 1989. In 1995 Deutsche Bahn donated the site to the Berlin city government as compensation for other environmental impacts caused by the company. The state-owned Grün Berlin was responsible for the expansion, and received financial assistance from the Allianz Umweltstiftung (Allianz Environmental Foundation).","Natur-Park Südgelände is a public park located in the municipality of Hagen in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

In 1959, Barck Wells transferred the shop to four of the craftsmen; Robert Bower, Daniel Pederson, Arne Myhre, and Yngve Olsson.  Barck hired women designers almost exclusively, although the immigrant Scandinavian craftsmen were male.  At its peak, Kalo employed 25 silversmiths.  After Barck's retirement, the firm continued to produce the pieces designed under her leadership until 1970, when it closed, due to the difficulty of finding young people willing to apprentice as silversmiths.

A member of the genus Iridomyrmex in the subfamily Dolichoderinae, it was described by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858. The meat ant is associated with many common names due to its appearance, nest-building behaviour and abundance, of which its specific name, purpureus, refers to its coloured appearance. It is among the best-known species of ant found throughout Australia; it occurs in almost all states and territories except for Tasmania. Its enormous distribution, aggression and ecological importance have made this ant a dominant species. The meat ant is monomorphic (occurs in a particular form), although there is evidence that certain populations can be polymorphic. It is characterised by its dark-bluish body and red head. It is a medium to large species, measuring . The workers and males are approximately the same sizes at  and , respectively. The queens are the largest and appear mostly black, measuring . The iridescence in workers ranges from green or blue to plain green and purple, varying in different body parts and castes. Meat ants inhabit open and warm areas in large, oval-shaped mounds that are accompanied by many entrance holes. The nest area is always cleared of vegetation and covered with materials including gravel, pebbles and dead vegetation. They are also polydomous, where a colony may be established in a series of satellite nests connected by well-defined paths and trails. Satellite nests are constructed away from the main nest and nearby areas with valuable food sources so workers can exploit them.","The meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus), also known as the Australian meat ant, is a species of ant in the genus Iridomyrmex.

However, the waltz was also chiefly noted by Strauss' biographers as the début of Strauss with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra where for many years, the Philharmonic had dismissed any association with the 'Waltz King' as it had not wished to be associated with mere 'light' or 'pops' music. The festival ball celebrating the event was held at the Musikverein Hall which is the venue for the present day Neujahrskonzert.

(1995), and Coombs and Hull (1996).  This body of work suggests that firms could enhance their overall performance by adopting a “process view” of the organization.  Although many firms have adopted the BPO concept, little to no empirical data existed substantiating its effectiveness in facilitating improved business performance.  McCormack (2000) conducted an empirical study to explore the relationship between BPO and enhanced business performance. The research results showed that BPO is critical in reducing conflict and encouraging greater connectedness within an organization, while improving business performance. Moreover, companies with strong measures of BPO showed better overall business performance. The research also showed that high BPO levels within organizations led to a more positive corporate climate, illustrated through better organizational connectedness and less internal conflict. Another empirical study by Kohlbacher (2009) reveals that BPO is positively associated with customer satisfaction, product quality, delivery speed and time-to-market speed. For a central concept, one that has become something of a Holy Grail for 1990s managers, BPO has remained remarkably hard to pin down.  Its champions argue that it is a new approach to management that replaces the rigid hierarchies of the past (""I report to my boss"") with structures that are much flatter, more cooperative, more process-oriented  (""I report to my customer."").  Many of us have had experience with both types of organization and we know intuitively what BPO feels like.  Yet, if you're like me, you want a more solid foundation on which to make decisions and recommendations.","The concept of business process orientation (BPO) emerged in the early 1990s as a response to the challenge of managing business processes in an increasingly complex and globalized world. BPO is a way of organizing the work that companies do to deliver their products or services. 

BPO is based on the idea that businesses should break down their processes into smaller, more manageable tasks, and then assign specific individuals or teams to complete those tasks. This approach helps companies to improve their efficiency and effectiveness by ensuring that the tasks that need to be completed are done in a coordinated manner. 

In addition, BPO helps companies to understand their customers better by understanding the steps that they take to purchase products or services.

Cold and hunger prevented them from doing so, however, and the two endured a year of hardship until Thanadelthur's travelling companion died.

481813,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing%20attack,Timing attack,"In cryptography, a timing attack is a side-channel attack in which the attacker attempts to compromise a cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms. Every logical operation in a computer takes time to execute, and the time can differ based on the input; with precise measurements of the time for each operation, an attacker can work backwards to the input. Finding secrets through timing information may be significantly easier than using cryptanalysis of known plaintext, ciphertext pairs. Sometimes timing information is combined with cryptanalysis to increase the rate of information leakage. Information can leak from a system through measurement of the time it takes to respond to certain queries. How much this information can help an attacker depends on many variables: cryptographic system design, the CPU running the system, the algorithms used, assorted implementation details, timing attack countermeasures, the accuracy of the timing measurements, etc. Timing attacks can be applied to any algorithm that has data-dependent timing variation.

His collection of myriapod specimens, today housed in the Natural History Museum of Vienna, includes many type specimens. His monographs on the myriapods of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the first comprehensive treatments of the large region's centipede and millipede faunas. He named nearly 130 taxa of millipedes (1 genus, 2 subgenera, 69 species and 56 variations) and over 40 centipede groups (2 genera, 29 species and 12 variations), as well as four taxa each of pauropods and symphylans. His work on millipedes pioneered the use of gonopods in millipede classification and species recognition. At least three authors have honored Latzel by naming a genus Latzelia (Scudder 1890, Bollman 1893, Verhoeff, 1895).

The theory addresses instances of apparent self-view confirmation strivings and details an economical description of why these behaviors occur. Focusing on the importance of the self-view and rational thought, (see self-esteem; self concept; self knowledge) Raison oblige theory (ROT) accounts for the evidence supporting SVT including the well documented seemingly mal-adaptive self verifying behaviors.  SVT states that a person is actively motivated to confirm their existing self view regardless of the objective accuracy or valence of that view. In other words, a person wants to confirm their currently held self views above and beyond wanting this information to be accurate or positive. (see self verification for details).
 ROT challenges the existence of a motive and offers a plausible explanation which can account for all instances of self-verifying behaviors.
 The fundamentals of ROT are that people are obliged by reason to accept information that is congruent with their currently held self views and reject information that is not. The theory challenges a self-verification motive, stating that people do not want to self-verify, they simply convey, through behaviour, cognitions that accurately and honestly reflect their own self views.","Raison Oblige Theory offers an alternate explanation for the existence of obligations.

The glucose and fructose are linked by an alpha-1,6-glycosidic bond (chemical name: 6-0-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose). Isomaltulose is present in honey and sugarcane extracts. It tastes similar to sucrose (table sugar) with half the sweetness. Isomaltulose, also known by the trade name Palatinose, is manufactured by enzymatic rearrangement (isomerization) of sucrose from beet sugar. The enzyme and its source were discovered in Germany in 1950, and since then its physiological role and physical properties have been studied extensively. Isomaltulose  has been used as an alternative to sugar in foods in Japan since 1985, in the EU since 2005, in the US since 2006, and in Australia and New Zealand since 2007, besides other countries worldwide. Analytical methods for characterization and assay of commercial isomaltulose are laid down, for example, in the Food Chemicals Codex.

History
It was originally named Castle's Wood's, as the land in the immediate area had once belonged to Jacob Castle, a frontiersman in the likes of Daniel Boone. Castle purchased the land from the Shawnee Indians, for very little in trade.  It is reported that the purchase was made with the Shawnee Indians for a ""hound dog, a knife, and a shot of whiskey. As a ""Long Hunter"", he spent long periods of time in the wilderness on hunting expeditions.  There he befriended the Indians that inhabited the land in the Castlewood area.  He married a Shawnee woman by the name of Gliding Swan and they produced many children. It has been said that Castle himself showed Daniel Boone the Cumberland Gap and areas west, which led to Boone's expedition and settlement of said lands.  Many descendants of Castle reside in Russell County, Virginia and the surrounding area.  Castle's father, Peter Cassell was a German emigrant to Pennsylvania who was influential in the Dutch movement to America.
The name was modified to Castlewood by the United States Postal Service in the late 1800s, as a simplification of the original spelling and pronunciation which was common during this time period.","Castlewood is a census-designated place (CDP) in Powhatan County, Virginia, United States.

Every trump card has a Hebrew letter written on it in the lower right corner, which is the letter that is associated with the card in the writings of Case. In contrast to some earlier occult tarot decks, which place the Fool card last in order, and associate it with the second-to-last Hebrew letter,  (such decks order the last Hebrew letter, , before ), the BOTA deck places the Fool card first in order, and therefore associates it with the first Hebrew letter, aleph.

Pwojè Pyebwa distributed free trees to farmers, and advised on the incorporation of trees into existing cropping arrangements based on anthropological research into the land tenure, agricultural systems, and the historical market-orientation of Haitian peasant farmers.

The area of severe damage, where over 80% of the buildings were destroyed, covered an area of 2,000 square kilometres. There were between 4,000 and 5,000 casualties. Tectonic setting
The easternmost part of Turkey lies within the complex zone of continuing continental collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The overall shortening that affects this area is accommodated partly by thrusting along the Bitlis-Zagros fold and thrust belt and partly by a mixture of sinistral strike-slip on SW-NE trending faults and dextral strike-slip on NW-SE trending faults. The earthquake was caused by movement on the Çaldıran Fault, one of the dextral faults, which had not been recognized before the earthquake. No earthquakes with magnitudes of 6 or greater were recorded within 100 km of Çaldıran in the preceding 74 years, possibly explaining why it was considered an area of only intermediate seismic risk (zone 3 out of the five-zone system of seismic risking used in Turkey at the time, with zone 1 being the highest).",The 1976 Çaldıran–Muradiye earthquake occurred at 14:22 UTC on December 24 in Turkey.

The model is simple in that it does not consider the actual merging process between vehicles as the two branch roadways come together. The only information required to calculate the flows leaving the two branch roadways are the capacities of the two branch roadways and the exiting capacity, the demands into the system, and a value describing how the two input flows interact. This latter input term is called the split priority, or merge ratio, and is defined as the proportion of the two input flows when both are operating in congested conditions.

12306328,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haloa,Haloa,"Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an Attic festival, celebrated principally at Eleusis, in honour of Demeter (Δήμητρα, η Αλωαίη), protector of the fruits of the earth, of Dionysus, god of the grape and of wine, and Poseidon (Ποσειδώνας ο Φυτάλμιος), god of the seashore vegetation. In Greek, the word hálōs (ἅλως) from which Haloa derives means “threshing-floor” or “garden.” While the general consensus is that it was a festival related to threshing—the process of loosening the edible part of cereal grain after harvest—some scholars disagree and argue that it was instead a gardening festival. Haloa focuses mainly on the “first fruits” of the harvest, partly as a grateful acknowledgement for the benefits the husbandmen received, partly as prayer that the next harvest would be plentiful. The festival was also called Thalysia or Syncomesteria. The festival 
Haloa took place every year, during the month Poseideon (Ποσειδέωνας), after the first harvest was over. The festival took place around the threshing floor (αλώνια) at the same time throughout Attica. All women were expected to attend this event, but men were almost always excluded. Men had a legal and moral expectation to pay for their wives’ expenses in these festivities.
The strange timing of the harvest festival—mid-winter—is significant as well. The Greeks regarded the festival as sacred to not only Demeter but also to Dionysus. With the inclusion of Dionysus in the festival worship, the date shifted towards the winter as “he possessed himself of the festivals of Demeter, took over her threshing-floor and compelled the anomaly of a winter threshing festival.” In many ways, the festival was just as connected, if not more so, with Dionysus than with Demeter. Thus, we see the power and influence of the incoming god and of the importance of wine to Greek cult activity. Practically, Greeks were able to coax out a harvest just early enough to revel with Dionysus.","Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an ancient city in the middle of the Nile Delta in present-day Al Fayyum governorate, Egypt. It was one of the most important cultural and commercial centers of Lower Egypt during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.

The site is located on the eastern bank of the River Nile, opposite to modern Cairo, and was originally settled during the Predynastic Period. The city was abandoned following a series of floods in the New Kingdom period, but was briefly occupied by the Roman Empire in the late 1st century AD.

Its name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had a rear entrance on a street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance to the police station, and over time the street and the Metropolitan Police became synonymous. The New York Times wrote in 1964 that, just as Wall Street gave its name to New York's financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London. The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name ""New Scotland Yard"" was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) moved its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed building on Broadway in Victoria. In summer 2013, it was announced that the force would move to the Curtis Green Building – which is the third building of New Scotland Yard's previous site (1890–1967) – and that the headquarters would be renamed Scotland Yard. In November 2016, MPS moved to its new headquarters, which continues to bear the name of ""New Scotland Yard"".","Scotland Yard (officially New Scotland Yard) is a central police station in London, England.

2952353,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical%20dichotomy,Classical dichotomy,"In macroeconomics, the classical dichotomy is the idea, attributed to classical and pre-Keynesian economics, that real and nominal variables can be analyzed separately. To be precise, an economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if real variables such as output  and real interest rates can be completely analyzed without considering what is happening to their nominal counterparts, the money value of output and the interest rate. In particular, this means that real GDP and other real variables can be determined without knowing the level of the nominal money supply or the rate of inflation.  An economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if money is neutral, affecting only the price level, not real variables. As such, if the classical dichotomy holds, money only affects absolute rather than the relative prices between goods. The classical dichotomy was integral to the thinking of some pre-Keynesian economists (""money as a veil"") as a long-run proposition and is found today in new classical theories of macroeconomics. In new classical macroeconomics there is a short-run Phillips curve which can shift vertically according to the rational expectations being reviewed continuously. In the strict sense, money is not neutral in the short-run, that is, classical dichotomy does not hold, since agents tend to respond to changes in prices and in the quantity of money through changing their supply decisions. However, money should be neutral in the long run, and the classical dichotomy should be restored in the long-run, since there was no relationship between prices and real macroeconomic performance at the data level. This view has serious economic policy consequences. In the long-run, owing to the dichotomy, money is not assumed to be an effective instrument in controlling macroeconomic performance, while in the short-run there is a trade-off between prices and output (or unemployment), but, owing to rational expectations, government cannot exploit it in order to build a systematic countercyclical economic policy.","In macroeconomics, the classical dichotomy is the distinction between market and planned economies. It is based on the differing assumptions made about the behavior of economic agents under market and planning conditions.

In a market economy, agents are assumed to be rational and self-interested. They will seek to maximize their profits, and will act in their own best interests. The allocation of resources will be determined by the interactions between these agents.

In a planned economy, agents are assumed to be committed to the common good. They will aim to fulfill the needs of the population as a whole, rather than focusing on individual profit. Planning decisions are based on a understanding of the future needs of society, rather than on current economic conditions.

The classical dichotomy has been challenged by recent research which suggests that there is little difference between market and planned economies in terms of their impact on social welfare.",2,313,150,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Classical dichotomy'

George Ronan attended the United States Military Academy for almost three years, from June 1808 to March 1811.  At the time Ronan matriculated, the fledgling institute of military education was six years old, and he accepted his commission in the academy's ninth year.  A trickle of shako-clad cadets graduated from the then-tiny institution of higher military training to take up duty stations in sensitive security points up and down the young United States.  One of the most threatened positions was a small stockaded fort and associated fur trading post near the southern tip of Lake Michigan.  Although the Chicago River and its hinterland was officially part of the United States, the Fort Dearborn soldiers and fur traders were sharply outnumbered by adjacent bands of Native Americans.  The predominant Chicago River tribe was the Potawatomi nation, a group of clans who retained their loyalty to the British even though their land had been nominally ceded to the U.S.A. by the 1783 Treaty of Paris.","Ensign George Ronan was a commissioned officer in the United States Navy.

The quarry produces a hard-wearing gritstone (also known as greywacke) which is listed as being nationally important for road building, and is one of four in the Yorkshire Dales National Park that produces this type of aggregate. The quarry operations have come under public scrutiny due to the amount of road traffic, leading to some of the output from Dry Rigg being moved from the adjacent railhead at Arcow Quarry.

41747191,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tytthus,Tytthus,"Tytthus is a genus of insects in family Miridae, the plant bugs. They are carnivorous, feeding upon the eggs of various planthoppers in the family Delphacidae, and thus are important in the biological control of pests. The genus is distributed throughout the Holarctic of the Northern Hemisphere, but species are also found in the tropics, in China, South America, Australia, and the Indo-Pacific. Type species
In 1860 Gustav Flor described a bug he found in Estonia and named it Capsus geminus. When Fieber established the genus Tytthus in 1864, he named two species to the genus, Zetterstedt's Capus pygmaeus and Flor's Capus geminus. Capus geminus thus became Tytthus geminus, by which name it was known as for well over a hundred years. In 1906 Kirkaldy named then Tytthus geminus as the type species for the genus. But, as Henry and Wheeler discovered in 1988, the name Capsus geminus was not available in 1860, because Thomas Say had already used it 1832 for another species entirely. So, after researching the various previous nomenclaturial acts regarding the bug, they discovered that the next available name was one used by Harry H. Knight in 1931 to describe the same bug as if it were a new species, but placing it in the genus Cyrtorhinus Fieber, 1858 as Reuter had made Tytthus a junior synonym of Cyrtorhinus. Knight's name, Cyrtorhinus pubescens was the oldest junior synonym. In 1992, Wheeler and Henry published a treatise reviewing the Miridae family occurring in the Holarctic, and formally corrected the nomenclaturial error in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, with the result that the type species was henceforth called Tytthus pubescens (Knight, 1931).","Tytthus is a genus of insects in the family Tingidae.

Regional airliners typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by turbofans or turboprops.

Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification 
Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification.  Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as “outsiders” to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators’ undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336). Practicing physicians viewed administrators with MDs more negatively than those without MDs because the former were thought to have “betrayed” the medical profession by assuming administrative roles (Hoff, 1999: 344).","Professional Identification is a type of social identification which allows individuals to be recognized as professionals in their field of work.

In contrast, informal professional identification is based on reputation and personal credibility.

It is an industry standard, used in a wide variety of applications and systems, including automated teller machines (ATMs), point-of-sale systems, and securities exchanges. Transactions are generally defined as the execution of an operation or set of operations on data. In banking and financial services, transactions are used to carry out day-to-day business activities such as processing payments, authorizing loans, and issuing securities.

TL1 was designed in the early 1970s by a team of programmers at American Express. TL1 was originally developed for the Amex Data Processing System (ADPS), which was one of the first large-scale transaction processing systems. ADPS was subsequently acquired by WorldCom in 1998. WorldCom continued to develop TL1 until 2003, when it was acquired by PayPal. PayPal continues to develop TL1 as part of its PayPal Transact language product line.

TL1 has been widely adopted by the banking and financial services industries because it is easy to learn and use. It is also versatile and can be used for a wide variety of applications and systems.",26,287

The community, located on both sides of the Rapidan River, was established in the late eighteenth century around the Waugh's Ford mill. The Orange and Alexandria Railroad built a line through the town in 1854, a post office was built at the river crossing, and its name was changed to Rapid Ann Station. Milling remained a major industry in the area up through the mid-twentieth century. Its strategic location along both a railroad and a river brought about several destructive raids during the Civil War. Willis’s mill (ca. 1772), which stood in the location of the current mill, was burned along with several homes and other structures, although the miller's house remained. The village of Rapid Ann Station resumed its prominence as a regional shipping point after the railroad was rebuilt following the Civil War, particularly for lumber and wood products. Its name was changed once again in 1886 to the present-day Rapidan.","Rapidan is a small unincorporated community in eastern Loudoun County, Virginia, United States. It is located on the Rapidan River near its confluence with the Occoquan River, northeast of Leesburg. Rapidan has a post office with ZIP code 22182.

The prototypical example of an ∞-topos is the ∞-category of sheaves of spaces on some topological space. But the notion is more flexible; for example, the ∞-category of étale sheaves on some scheme is not the ∞-category of sheaves on any topological space but it is still an ∞-topos. Precisely, in Lurie's Higher Topos Theory, an ∞-topos is defined as an ∞-category X such that there is a small ∞-category C and a left exact localization functor from the ∞-category of presheaves of spaces on C to X. A theorem of Lurie states that an ∞-category is an ∞-topos if and only if it satisfies an ∞-categorical version of Giraud’s axioms in ordinary topos theory. A ""topos"" is a category behaving like the category of sheaves of sets on a topological space. In analogy, Lurie's definition and characterization theorem of an ∞-topos says that an ∞-topos is an ∞-category behaving like the category of sheaves of spaces.","In mathematics, an ∞-topos is, roughly, an object of study in category theory that generalizes the notion of a topos, which is a foundational concept in mathematics. ∞-toposes are more general, in the sense that they can deal with objects that are not sets.

14476384,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%20versus%20weight,Mass versus weight,"In common usage, the mass of an object is often referred to as its weight, though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. In scientific contexts, mass is the amount of ""matter"" in an object (though ""matter"" may be difficult to define), whereas weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity. In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram weighs approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the Earth, which is its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength. The object's weight is less on Mars, where gravity is weaker, and more on Saturn, and very small in space when far from any significant source of gravity, but it always has the same mass. Objects on the surface of the Earth have weight, although sometimes the weight is difficult to measure. An example is a small object floating in water, which does not appear to have weight since it is buoyed by the water; but it is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported by and weighed on a scale. Thus, the ""weightless object"" floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container (where the pressure increases). Similarly, a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even negative weight, due to buoyancy in air. However the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface, making the weight difficult to measure. The weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. If the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the Earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread over a larger area.","In common usage, the mass of an object is the weight of the object divided by the density of the object. The weight of an object is the force of gravity acting on the object.

The mass of an object is not always proportional to its weight. For example, a planet has more mass than a comet, despite having less weight due to its higher density. 

The mass of an object is also not always uniform. For example, a rock has more mass in its center than on its surface.",3,307,89,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Mass versus weight'

It is common on shallow coral reefs across the Indo-West Pacific, from Pakistan to New Guinea. Reaching up to  in length, the coral catshark has an extremely slender body, a short head and tail, and two dorsal fins that are angled backwards. It can be identified by the numerous black and white spots on its back, sides, and fins, which often merge to form horizontal bars. Furthermore, adult males have distinctively long and thin claspers. Reclusive and inactive during the day, at dusk and at night, the coral catshark actively forages for small, bottom-living invertebrates and bony fishes. Its slender form allows it to access tight spaces on the reef. It is oviparous; females lay purse-shaped egg capsules two at a time on the bottom, and the young hatch after 4–6 months. This small, harmless shark adapts well to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it is regarded as one of the most suitable shark species for private aquarists. The coral catshark is a minor bycatch of reef fisheries, with minimal commercial value. Increasing fishing activity and extensive habitat degradation occur within its range, leading to concern over its population and its assessment as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.","The coral catshark (Atelomycterus marmoratus) is a common and widespread species of catshark, found in the central and eastern Atlantic Ocean.

In the twelfth century Monfragüe was the centre of a Mountjoy commandary before it became the headquarters of its own order. The earliest reference to the commandary is in an economic transaction involving the commander, Gonzalo Padilla, and his fellow brothers (freyes, freires) of the Order. As early as 1186 the Order had tried to amalgamate with the Templars but failed. The remaining decade of its existence was spent in a state of utter collapse. The Order was united in December 1187 with the Hospital of the Holy Redeemer, but already a distinction had appeared in its ranks between the master of the order, Fralmo, and his followers on one hand and the commander of the Order in the Kingdom of Castile, Rodrigo González, and his support. By mid-1188 there was a schism in the Order, though it does not appear to have broken down along the lines Castile and León on one hand and the Crown of Aragon on the other, as sometimes supposed. When the final split occurred in 1196, over the successful amalgamation with the Templars, all opponents of the merger would have had to leave the lands of Alfonso II of Aragon, a strong supporter of the Temple.","The Order of Monfragüe  was a military and civil order of Spain.

The exhibition showcased the work of eight artists who were known for portraying gritty scenes of daily life, especially of poorer communities in New York: Robert Henri, William Glackens, George Luks, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur Bowen Davies, Ernest Lawson, and Maurice Prendergast. Though they had varying styles, the artists were later known collectively as ""The Eight"". Henri, Glackens, Luks, Shinn, and Sloan were associated with the Ashcan School, and the 1908 exhibition brought increased national attention to that movement and founded their reputations. In 1948, Andrew Wyeth's painting Christina's World was first exhibited at the Macbeth Gallery before it was purchased by the Museum of Modern Art.","The Macbeth Gallery was an art gallery in Liverpool, England, which operated from 1892 until 1954.

The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the National Basketball Association (NBA), and potentially so in the NBA). Technical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States.  First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the United States, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running or when the ball is dead. Second, in International Basketball Federation (FIBA) play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; committing another risks immediate ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the (W)NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs.","In basketball, a technical foul (colloquially known as a ""tech"") is a penalty assessed to a player by the referee for unsportsmanlike conduct. A technical foul is one of several penalties available to the referee, which can be called for various reasons, such as ball-stopping, arguing with the referee, or physical contact with an opponent. In some cases, when a technical foul is called against a player who is already in violation of the rules, that player will be assessed another technical foul.

A technical foul results in a player being ejected from the game and may also lead to a suspension from future games. A second technical foul results in an automatic ejection; any subsequent technical fouls will result in additional ejections.

Kent has one of the highest concentrations of such surviving medieval timber-framed buildings in Europe. The original floor plan usually had four bays with the two central ones forming the main hall open to the roof with the hearth in the middle and two doors to the outside at one end forming a cross passage. The open hearth was later moved towards the cross passage and became a fireplace with chimney, sometimes the chimney pile even blocking the cross passage, which had soon been screened off the main hall. Beyond the cross passage the outer bay at the ""screens end"" or ""lower end"" of the hall, usually contained two rooms commonly called buttery and pantry, while the rooms in the bay at the other end, the ""upper end"", were called parlours. The end bays each had an upper floor containing solars, which did not communicate with each other, as the hall rose to the rafters between them. The upper stories on both ends typically extended beyond the lower outer wall being jettied on at least one side of the building. As the main hall had no upper floor the outer wall ran straight up without jettying, and thus the central bays appeared recessed. 
The early buildings had  thatched roofs and walls of wattle and daub often whitewashed.

Lacking photosynthetic pigments, leucoplasts are not green and are located in non-photosynthetic tissues of plants, such as roots, bulbs and seeds. They may be specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid or protein and are then known as amyloplasts, elaioplasts, or proteinoplasts (also called aleuroplasts) respectively. However, in many cell types, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function and are present to provide a wide range of essential biosynthetic functions, including the synthesis of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, many amino acids, and tetrapyrrole compounds such as heme. In general, leucoplasts are much smaller than chloroplasts and have a variable morphology, often described as amoeboid. Extensive networks of stromules interconnecting leucoplasts have been observed in epidermal cells of roots, hypocotyls, and petals, and in callus and suspension culture cells of tobacco. In some cell types at certain stages of development, leucoplasts are clustered around the nucleus with stromules extending to the cell periphery, as observed for proplastids in the root meristem.","Leucoplasts (λευκός leukós ""white"", πλαστός plastós ""formed, solid"") are organelles found in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells.

(The Nestlé brand Toll House cookies is named for the inn.)  The cookies were a huge success, and Wakefield reached an agreement in 1939 with Nestlé to add her recipe to the chocolate bar's packaging in exchange for a lifetime supply of chocolate.

The last 1.5 km are seldom visited, ending at the cape of Havknude.  Here the beach turns into a stony shoreline, that continues  30 km down the east coast of the peninsula of Djursland, facing the Kattegat between Denmark and Sweden. This coastline south of Grenaa Beach is renowned amongst anglers. Recreational
There are a lot of summer rentals close to the town of Grenaa and Grenaa Beach, and the beach is a recreational asset for these houses and for the inhabitants of Grenaa.  Facing east away from the predominant westerly winds, and protected from the Atlantic, increases the amount of good beech days. The summer temperature in Denmark is seldom unpleasantly hot.  With a band of dunes the beach has sheltered spots along the coast if its to chilly to stay on the open beach.  Apart from Danes, Grenaa beach is mostly visited by Swedes, Norwegians and Germans. It is not overcrowded, as Denmark, as well as the rest of Scandinavia, is significantly less populated than the neighbouring central European countries. The uncrowded nature is also due to many other beach-alternatives on Denmarks long coastline. On the peninsula, Djursland, where Grenaa Beach lies, there are 21 other sandy beaches. In 2006 Grenaa Beach was nominated as one of the 2 best beaches in Denmark, by The Danish Tourist Board. Many Danes have a good working knowledge of English. Katholm Strandvej runs parallel to the major part of the beach, with free parking and access to the shoreline without long walks. This, and a coastline facing east, with no tide or current to speak of under normal summer conditions, makes the beach child friendly and safe. The water is tested and certified as clean and non-polluted, under the Danish ""Blue Flag"" system.","Sandy Grenaa Beach on Djursland's east coast is a wide, sandy beach with crystal-clear water.

The dance form, originating in France during the 17th century, began as a theatrical dance. It was not until the 19th century that ballet gained status as a “classical” form. In ballet, the terms ‘classical’ and ‘romantic’ are chronologically reversed from musical usage. Thus, the 19th century Classical period in ballet coincided with the 19th century Romantic era in music. Ballet music composers from the 17th–20th centuries, including the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev, were predominantly in France and Russia. Yet with the increased international notoriety seen in Tchaikovsky's and Stravinsky's lifetime, ballet music composition and ballet in general spread across the western world. History
Until about the second half of the 19th century, the role of music in ballet was secondary, with the main emphasis on dance, while music was simply a compilation of danceable tunes. Writing ""ballet music"" used to be a job for musical craftsmen, rather than for masters. For example, critics of the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) mentioned his writing of ballet music as something demeaning.","Ballet as a music form progressed from its origins in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century to become one of the most prominent and renowned art forms in the world. While ballet initially served as an accompaniment to song, it developed into its own distinct genre, characterized by its choreography, music and dramatic elements.

In the early days of ballet, courtly performances were accompanied by music played on pipe organs or harpsichords. As courtly dances grew more elaborate and intricate, however, their accompanying music became too difficult for courtiers to play. This led to the development of an entirely new form of ballet music, known as chamber ballet. Chamber ballet was typically performed by a small group of dancers accompanied only by string instruments such as violins or cellos.

As ballet grew in popularity and complexity, it began to be performed in larger venues with a wider range of accompanying musicians. This led to the creation of opera ballets, which featured lavish sets and costumes and extended dance scenes that could take up entire performances. Opera ballets were typically performed by large castes of actors and dancers who wore elaborate costumes and makeup.

Today, ballet is one of the most popular forms of art in the world. It is widely enjoyed by people of all ages, and is often used as an educational tool in schools.

He was born and died at Watchet, Somerset. Pearse was a middle-order right-handed batsman whose club cricket was for Watchet Cricket Club, where Harold Gimblett was his contemporary. As a 16-year-old, playing for Watchet against Wellington Cricket Club, he joined Gimblett with the Watchet score at 37 for seven chasing a total of 160. The pair added the 123 runs needed, Gimblett scoring 91 and Pearse 33. Pearse followed Gimblett into the Somerset side, making his debut in 1936 at the Agricultural Showgrounds, Frome, the same ground where Gimblett had made his sensational debut a year earlier. In his first innings he scored 20, which was the second highest of the Somerset innings against Kent. But in five other first-class matches in the 1936 season he failed to score more than 10 in any innings, and in two matches in 1937 he also made little impression.

60903664,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length%20of%20pull,Length of pull,"Length of pull (sometimes abbreviated as LOP) is the distance from the trigger to the part of a rifle or shotgun which fits against the shoulder of the shooter. Length of pull is an important ergonomic factor for ease of use; and optimum length of pull may vary with the size of the shooter, the thickness of chest clothing and body armor being worn, and whether the shooter is firing from a standing, sitting, or prone position. Variation
Many rifles and shotguns are manufactured with a standard length of pull assumed to fit most shooters. This is often approximately  for rifles and about  longer for shotguns. Shooters with short arms may find the buttstock dragging along the underside of their arm as they attempt to raise the firearm into firing position. Shooters with broad shoulders or a long neck may experience face injuries from collision with the telescopic sight or thumb of the trigger hand as the firearm recoils. Modern firearms may be equipped with a telescoping stock or removable spacers to adjust the length of pull. Gunsmiths may adjust the length of pull of custom-built firearms or older firearms by cutting off a portion of the buttstock or adding a recoil pad to the buttstock. Some sources suggest a shooter's optimum length of pull will allow the butt of the firearm to exactly reach the inside of the elbow when the hand of that arm grips the unloaded firearm with a finger on the trigger. Other sources suggest a more appropriate determination may be made using a non-firing ""try-gun"" resembling a firearm with an adjustable buttstock. When a properly adjusted try-gun is held in a firing position, the shooter's nose should be about two finger-widths behind the thumb of the trigger hand.","Length of pull (sometimes abbreviated as LOP) is the distance between the grip surface and the butt of a firearm.

Length of pull is important for two reasons. The first reason is that it affects the balance of a firearm. A firearm with a shorter LOP will be more stable in the hand, while a firearm with a longer LOP will be less stable. The second reason is that it affects how easily the firearm can be pulled back. A shorter LOP will require more effort to pull back the firearm, while a longer LOP will allow for easier pulling.",3,294,99,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Length of pull'

Hanson was a pioneer in advancing the argument that observation is theory-laden — that observation language and theory language are deeply interwoven — and that historical and contemporary comprehension are similarly deeply interwoven. His single most central intellectual concern was the comprehension and development of a logic of discovery. Work
Hanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions – a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p. 11), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Charles Sanders Peirce's notion of abduction for this.","Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – September 5, 2003) was an American philosopher.

However, using an editing technique known as the substitution splice, Méliès carried out the trick using cinematic special effects rather than conventional stage machinery. The substitution splice also allowed Méliès to add new material to the end of the trick, inventing the appearance and transformation of the skeleton prop and d'Alcy's return.

It is almost identical to their third Danish album, Gasolin' 3 and was released in some Western European countries in the beginning of 1974 on CBS. It failed to make impact on the charts anywhere, but didn't stop Gasolin' from issuing three more albums in English in the period from 1974 to 1978. History 
After the artistic and commercial success of Gasolin' 2, singer and principal songwriter Kim Larsen left the band. He was unhappy as he felt that too many of his new songs were rejected by the other band members. Poul Bruun, the director of CBS in Denmark, afraid to see the band disappear resolved the situation by letting Larsen record a solo album, Værsgo. He further allowed Gasolin' to record their next album in two versions, one in Danish for the home market and one with English lyrics to be released in Europe. To provide the right international sound, the record company brought Englishman Roy Thomas Baker to Copenhagen to produce the album in August 1973. Baker, at the time a hot name in the record industry following his recent success with Queen, had already worked as engineer on the band's debut album Gasolin' in 1970 and was happy to work with them again. After finishing Gasolin' 3, the band teamed up with Leonard ""Skip"" Malone, an American living in Denmark at the time, who helped the band translate the Danish lyrics into English. The lyrics were re-recorded in January 1974 and the resulting album released shortly after.","Gasolin' is the first album with English lyrics by the rock band Led Zeppelin, released in December 1974. The album was recorded between November and December 1973 at Atlantic Studios in New York City, and produced by Jimmy Page.

Gasolin' reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and number six on the ""Billboard"" 200, becoming their first top ten album in the United States. It has since been certified gold by the RIAA.

597785,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse%20possession,Adverse possession,"Adverse possession, sometimes colloquially described as ""squatter's rights"", is a legal principle in the Anglo-American common law under which a person who does not have legal title to a piece of property—usually land (real property)—may acquire legal ownership based on continuous possession or occupation of the property without the permission (licence) of its legal owner. The possession by a person is not adverse if they are in possession as a tenant or licensee of the legal owner. In general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorised possessors through legal action such as ejectment. However, in the English common law tradition, courts have long ruled that when someone occupies a piece of property without permission and the property's owner does not exercise their right to recover their property for a significant period of time, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to exclude, but an entirely new title to the property ""springs up"" in the adverse possessor. In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property's new owner. Over time, legislatures have created statutes of limitations that specify the length of time that owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. In the United States, for example, these time limits vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as three years to as long as 40 years.","Adverse possession, sometimes colloquially described as ""squatter's rights"", is the legal doctrine that allows a person to become the legal owner of property by occupying it without the consent of the owner for a certain amount of time.",2,230,38,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Adverse possession'

Their cases are internationally renowned and are used by many leading soloists including Sarah Chang, Joshua Bell, Salvatore Accardo, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Isaac Stern, Uto Ughi, and Chloë Hanslip. History
The company was founded in 1983 by violinist and luthier Dimitri Musafia, who studied violin making at the Stradivari Institute. Musafia's objective was to create a violin case which focused primarily on instrument safety and aesthetics. After experimenting with variety of different materials over several years, a ""specially-milled wood laminate"" emerged as the preferred choice for the basis of construction, satisfying the requirements for both instrument safety and portability. Since then, Musafia cases have been the preferred choice for some of the most famous and expensive violins in the world, including Guarneris and the 1715 Stradivarius ""Cremonese"", previously played by Joseph Joachim. The construction specifics have changed over the years to ensure that their high standards are upheld. Up to this day, Musafia has remained a family-owned business, with all aspects of design and construction taking place in the company's Cremona workshop and overseen by Dmitri personally.","Musafia is an Italian manufacturer of violin strings, founded in 1690.

Additionally, it is most commonly found as a secondary mineral in granite pegmatite. Samuelsonite is named after Peter B. Samuelson, a prospector from Rumney, New Hampshire.  The mineral has a pale yellow color and has a hardness of 5 on Mohs scale. The crystal is generally yellow, flat, and with straited crystals and blue trolleites. Samuelsonite is monolinic. There are three vectors of unequal length in this crystal system. The three vectors form a rectangular prism with a parallelogram at the base. Therefore, two of the vectors are perpendicular, while the third makes an angle that is not equal to 90°. Samuelsonite has biaxial birefringence (trirefringence), meaning when light passes through the optic axis it is split into two rays due to the difference in refractive index of the ray with parallel polarized light compared to the ray with perpendicular polarized light.","Samuelsonite is a complex mineral that is known for its unique color and crystal structure.

Jacobson was born in 1971 to a Jewish family. His father was an inventor and his mother was a teacher. Jacobson was raised in Watford. A talented musician, his childhood ambition was to become a singer, and he spent more time on music than education when at school, singing or playing at the Royal Opera House, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, the Barbican and St Martin-in-the-Fields during this time, and appeared in Carmen alongside José Carreras. However his singing ability was affected by the voice change during puberty. He attended Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School on a scholarship – fellow pupils at the time included Matt Lucas and Sacha Baron Cohen. He also became a keen fan of Watford F.C. in his childhood, attending his first game at Vicarage Road on his seventh birthday. His interest in and love for music sowed the seeds for his early career; while working in a record shop he produced a fanzine which caught the eye of the then NME editor Steve Lamacq. Lamacq helped Jacobson to secure his first position in the music business, introducing him to Andy Ross of Food Records, who hired him as an A&R manager. During his time in the music business (with Food and Polygram Island Music), Jacobson worked with a number of household names, including Jesus Jones, Dubstar, Shampoo, Blur, Feeder, Fatboy Slim and The Bluetones.","Miles Jacobson OBE is studio director of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

Historically, the street was one of the main routes into Edinburgh from the south, meeting St Mary's Wynd (now St Mary's Street) at St Mary's Wynd Port, one of the gateways of the town walls. The name derives from the Scots plesance, meaning a park or garden. It first appears in 1507 as the name of a nearby house, and was later transferred to the street and then the suburb which was part of the regality of the Canongate. The derivation of the name from a nunnery of St Mary of Placentia, often mentioned in histories of Edinburgh, is an invention by William Maitland in his 1753 History of Edinburgh. The street is largely residential - mainly 19th century tenements and 20th century flats - although the University of Edinburgh owns property in the area, including a large new [2017] university student flats complex on St Leonard's Street, the southerly extension of the Pleasance, on a site formerly occupied by a Homebase home improvements and gardening store.

Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, south of Mexico, in mid-October 2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hours—a near-record pace. On October 23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h). This made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of one-minute maximum sustained winds. Late on October 23, dramatic weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). This still made it the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. Within 24 hours of moving ashore, Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter, late on October 24.","Hurricane Patricia was the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere, and the fifth-most intense hurricane on record.

He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse echo technique for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “[a] device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone proposed an alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk Maxwell in which force is made the analogy of voltage (the impedance analogy).  Firestone's analogy (now called the mobility analogy) makes force the analogy of current.  In this work he introduced the concept of ""through"" and ""across"" variables and demonstrated that there were analogies for these variables in other energy domains, making it possible to treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.  Firestone's analogy became popular amongst mechanical filter designers because it has the property of preserving network topologies when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.","Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical engineer and inventor who developed the first practical synthetic rubber.

26405633,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor%20proofing,Monitor proofing,"Monitor proofing or soft-proofing is a step in the prepress printing process. It uses specialized computer software and hardware to check the accuracy of text and images used for printed products. Monitor proofing differs from conventional forms of “hard-copy” or ink-on-paper color proofing in its use of a calibrated display(s) as the output device. Monitor proofing systems rely on calibration, profiling and color management to produce an accurate representation of how images will look when printed. 
While a “soft-proof” function has existed in desktop publishing applications for some time, commercial monitor proofing extends this capability to multiple users and multiple locations by specifying the hardware to be used, and by enforcing one set of calibration procedures and color management policies for all users of the system. This ensures that all viewers are calibrated to a known set of conditions, and given hardware of equal capabilities will therefore be viewing the same color on screen.","Monitor proofing or soft-proofing is a step in the editorial process of producing a digital publication where one checks the look, feel, and content of a document before it is published online. The purpose of this step is to ensure that all content is correct and that no errors have been made.

Monitor proofing can be divided into two categories: hard and soft. Hard monitor proofing is where the document is checked against a set of predetermined standards. Soft monitor proofing refers to the use of software to check the document against user feedback. This feedback can come from a survey, an anonymous user rating system, or comments from fellow editors.

There are several reasons for conducting monitor proofing. One reason is to make sure that all the content in a document is accurate. Another reason is to make sure that all of the formatting is correct. Finally, monitor proofing can be used to check for typos and other errors.

Polk to provide Congress with the exact location (the ""spot"") upon which blood was spilled on American soil, as Polk had claimed in 1846 when asking Congress to declare war on Mexico. So persistent was Lincoln in pushing his ""spot resolutions"" that some began referring to him as ""spotty Lincoln."" Lincoln's resolutions were a direct challenge to the validity of the president's words, and representative of an ongoing political power struggle between Whigs and Democrats. Eight resolutions sought specific information. The first: ""whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as in his messages declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at least after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution."" The second: ""whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was wrested from Spain by the revolutionary Government of Mexico."" The other six resolutions extended the analysis to determine whether the territory on which the casualties occurred was ever under the government or laws of Texas or of the United States. The House of Representatives never acted on Lincoln's resolutions, but they demonstrated the Whig reluctance to accept President Polk’s grounds to begin the war.","The spot resolutions were offered in the United States by the New York State Department of Health in an effort to reduce the number of cases of tuberculosis.

When Dahomey gained its independence from France on August 1, 1960, Maga was appointed to the presidency, and was officially elected to that post on December 11. During Maga's term of office, Dahomey's economy collapsed; there was little foreign investment and unemployment rose. In response, he launched a four-year plan in January 1962, the basis of which was to increase agricultural production by forcing the nation's youths to work on the land. Maga also faced a national crisis of unity, culminating in a failed assassination plot against him in May 1961 led by the main opposition leader, Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin. Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin was jailed, and by the time of his release in November 1962, a one-party state had been established and the opposition press had been restricted.

The riots became so serious that the Chief of Staff of the Dahomeyan Army, Christophe Soglo, took control of the country in October to prevent a civil war.

The title is drawn from a song in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night that urges carpe diem (""present mirth hath present laughter""). The play has been frequently revived in Britain, the US and beyond. The plot depicts a few days in the life of the successful and self-obsessed light comedy actor Garry Essendine as he prepares to travel for a touring commitment in Africa. Amid a series of events bordering on farce, Garry has to deal with women who want to seduce him, placate both his long-suffering secretary and his wife, cope with a crazed young playwright, and overcome his impending mid-life crisis (he has recently turned forty). The character is a caricature of the author's real-life persona, as Coward acknowledged.","Present Laughter is a comic play written by William Congreve in 1712. It is a satire of the manners and customs of its day and is often considered to be one of the most important comedies in the English language.

With an angel—a creature of fantasy unlike a religious angel—as protagonist and taking place in contemporary England, the book could be classified as contemporary fantasy, although the genre was not recognised in Wells's time.  The Wonderful Visit also has strong satirical themes, gently mocking customs and institutions of Victorian England as well as idealistic rebellion itself. Plot summary
The Wonderful Visit tells how an angel spends a little more than a week in southern England. He is at first mistaken for a bird because of his dazzling polychromatic plumage, for he is ""neither the Angel of religious feeling nor the Angel of popular belief,"" but rather ""the Angel of Italian art."" As a result, he is hunted and shot in the wing by an amateur ornithologist, the Rev. K. Hilyer, the vicar of Siddermoton, and then taken in and cared for at the vicarage. The creature comes from ""the Land of Dreams"" (also the angel's term for our world), and while ""charmingly affable,"" is ""quite ignorant of the most elementary facts of civilisation."" During his brief visit he grows increasingly dismayed by what he learns about the world in general and about life in Victorian England in particular. As he grows increasingly critical of local mores, he is eventually denounced as ""a Socialist.""","The Wonderful Visit is an 1895 novel written by Kate Douglas Wiggin.

It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings. Particularly in childhood, a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment. In animals, observational learning is often based on classical conditioning, in which an instinctive behavior is elicited by observing the behavior of another (e.g. mobbing in birds), but other processes may be involved as well. Human observational learning
Many behaviors that a learner observes, remembers, and imitates are actions that models display and display modeling, even though the model may not intentionally try to instill a particular behavior. A child may learn to swear, smack, smoke, and deem other inappropriate behavior acceptable through poor modeling. Albert Bandura claims that children continually learn desirable and undesirable behavior through observational learning. Observational learning suggests that an individual's environment, cognition, and behavior all incorporate and ultimately determine how the individual functions and models.","Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a type of learning that occurs outside the traditional setting of a classroom or school, and often involves using naturalistic observation methods such as participant observation, ethnography, and field research.

It is argued to be either a possible extraterrestrial impact crater or an impact structure. It lies between Bridgetown and West Dalhousie, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, where the Bloody Creek structure straddles what was once a stretch of Bloody Creek. It also is informally known as the Astrid crater. History 
The Bloody Creek structure was discovered by Dr. George R. Stevens, a retired geologist from Acadia University, in 1987 during a regional air photo survey. By the time of its discovery, it had been submerged beneath a reservoir, Dalhousie Lake. Dalhousie Lake was created by a dam constructed across Bloody Creek by the Nova Scotia Power Corporation as part of the Bloody Creek Reservoir hydroelectric development. As a result, the collection of rock samples from crater rim and its surroundings required the use of scuba gear and visiting the site during the occasional periods when the reservoir was drained. When the surface of Dalhousie Lake was frozen, the thick ice created a platform that greatly facilitated magnetometer and ground-penetrating radar surveys of this feature. Prior to being flooded, the interior of the Bloody Creek structure consisted of a fen within the floodplain of Bloody Creek.","Bloody Creek crater, which is also known as the Bloody Creek caldera, is a large and symmetrical volcanic crater located in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. The crater is about 150 metres in diameter and up to 50 metres deep.

The crater was formed about 1.5 million years ago by an eruption of the Mount Arthur Volcanic Group. The eruption produced a large volume of ash, which was carried by the wind to the North-West and deposited over a wide area including Bloody Creek. This ash layer has preserved many features of the pre-existing landscape including moraines, lakes, and valleys.

Today, Bloody Creek is a popular tourist destination due to its beauty and historical significance. The crater is home to a number of rare plants and animals, including the endemic southern beech tree.",3,222,132,"200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Bloody Creek crater'

The bulk of his career was as a journalist, book author, and editor with Time Life. Scott began his adult life as an idealistic socialist of democratic socialist character and traveled to the Soviet Union in 1932 to be part of the early Soviet zeitgeist of enthusiastically building socialism. He worked as a welder, chemist, and foreman at the new city of Magnitogorsk and married and had children there. He was disillusioned in 1937 and 1938 by the Great Purge, which removed him from normal Soviet life as a suddenly distrusted foreigner and which disappeared many of his Russian colleagues. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, he remained sympathetic to socialist ideals but had soured on Stalinism as the path for socialist development, although he believed that the Soviet economy was succeeding in raising the standard of living of the populace and that the Soviet regime would endure as long as that remained true. He moved back to the United States with his family and published his book about his Soviet experience. He worked in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II.  The OSS was the predecessor organization to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). After that war, he was a journalist with Time magazine for several decades. He published various other books.

It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the strategically important Downs anchorage off the English coast. Comprising a keep with six inner and outer bastions, the moated stone castle covered  and had sixty-six firing positions for artillery. It cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build the three castles of Deal, Sandown and Walmer, which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences. The original invasion threat passed but, during the Second English Civil War of 1648–49, Deal was seized by pro-Royalist insurgents and was only retaken by Parliamentary forces after several months' fighting. Although it remained armed, Deal was adapted by Sir John Norris and Lord Carrington during the 18th and 19th centuries to form a more suitable private house for the castle's captain, which was by now an honorary position. In 1904, the War Office concluded that the castle no longer had any value either as a defensive site or as a barracks and it was opened to the public when the captain was not in residence. Early in the Second World War, the captain's quarters were destroyed by German bombing, forcing Deal's then-captain, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace and the castle became an observation post for an artillery battery placed along the shore line. The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction.

Legal basis

After his death in 1975, Spain transitioned into a democracy. During this time period Spain was officially known as the Spanish State . The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 April 1939, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as ""fascistized dictatorship"", or ""semi-fascist regime"", showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system.

It is a technique that allows the introduction of cytochemistry into a freeze fracture cell membrane. immunocytochemistry is used in this technique to label and visualize the cell membrane's molecules. This technique could be useful in analyzing the ultrastructure of cell membranes. The combination of immunocytochemistry and freeze fracture enzyme technique, research can identify and have a better understanding of the structure and distribution of a cell membrane.","Cytochemistry is the branch of cell biology that focuses on the chemical analysis of biological tissues and cells. This can include the examination of proteins, DNA, and other cellular components. Cytochemistry is used to study the function of cells, to diagnose diseases, and to explore the relationship between cells and their environment.

Cytochemistry is a highly specialized field that requires a great deal of knowledge and expertise. Many cytochemists work in research labs or universities, conducting experiments on a variety of substances in order to learn more about how cells work. Others work in pharmaceutical companies, analyzing drugs to make sure they are effective and safe.

It is typically composed of canvas woven of acrylic, cotton or polyester yarn, or vinyl laminated to polyester fabric that is stretched tightly over a light structure of aluminium, iron or steel, possibly wood or transparent material (used to cover solar thermal panels in the summer, but that must allow as much light as possible in the winter). The configuration of this structure is something of a truss, space frame or planar frame. Awnings are also often constructed of aluminium understucture with aluminium sheeting. These aluminium awnings are often used when a fabric awning is not a practical application where snow load as well as wind loads may be a factor. The location of an awning on a building may be above a window, a door, or above the area along a sidewalk. With the addition of columns an awning becomes a canopy, which is able to extend further from a building, as in the case of an entrance to a hotel. Restaurants often use awnings broad enough to cover substantial outdoor area for outdoor dining, parties, or reception. In commercial buildings, an awning is often painted with information as to the name, business, and address, thus acting as a sign or billboard as well as providing shade, breaking strong winds, and protecting from rain or snow. In areas with wintry weather, most awnings do not have to be taken down at the end of the summer – they can remain retracted against the building all winter long, or be designed and built for those conditions.","An awning or overhang is a secondary roof thatprotects pedestrians and vehicles from the sun and rain.

Nevertheless, they share many common elements such as the Mycenaean civilisation, which flourished during their Bronze Age period, Classical antiquity, which saw their greatest achievements in literature and philosophy, and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The first recorded use of the term ""Greeks"" is in Herodotus' Histories, which refers to them as Γραικοί (Greeks), where he distinguishes them from Ionian Greeks and Aeolian Peloponnesians. He describes them as a people who live in the Peloponnese, whose language he does not know. Although Herodotus identifies them as Greeks, his description has been disputed",27,300

Known to his contemporaries as a novelist, diplomat and travel writer, he was an elitist who, in the immediate aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848, wrote An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races. In it he argued aristocrats were superior to commoners, and that aristocrats possessed more Aryan genetic traits because of less interbreeding with inferior races. Gobineau's writings were quickly praised by white supremacist, pro-slavery Americans like Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze, who translated his book into English. They omitted around 1,000 pages of the original book, including those parts that negatively described Americans as a racially mixed population. Inspiring a social movement in Germany named Gobinism, his works were also influential on prominent antisemites like Richard Wagner, Wagner's son-in-law Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the Romanian politician Professor A. C. Cuza, and leaders of the Nazi Party, who later edited and re-published his work.","Joseph Arthur de Gobineau (; 14 July 1776 – 5 February 1852) was a French aristocrat, conservative political theorist, and historian.

Gobineau was born in Paris to a wealthy family of the minor nobility. He pursued a military career, but resigned from the army in 1794 after coming into conflict with the authorities. He then turned to politics, and became a supporter of the French Revolution. In 1802 he was elected to the National Assembly, where he supported Louis-Philippe I's policies.

After the Donghu ""Eastern Barbarians"" were defeated by the Xiongnu around 209 BC, they split into two groups.

The Book of Later Han (Ch. 120) says: ""From the time that Modu Shanyu crushed them the Wuhuan became weak. They were kept in constant subjugation to the Xiongnu and were forced to pay annual taxes of cow, horse and sheep skins.

Much of the range is within the boundary of the Flat Tops Wilderness Area. While there are notable peaks in the Flat Tops, the dominant feature of the range is the high plateau from which the peaks arise. The plateau forms the northeastern portion of the White River Uplift capped by horizontal basalt flows from tertiary volcanic activity and is bounded by steep drops to valleys carved out by subsequent glaciation. The resulting mix of areas of treeless plateau at an elevation of 11,000 to 12,000 feet interspersed with verdant valleys is unique among Colorado mountain ranges. The area contains approximately one hundred and ten ponds and lakes and is home to a wide variety of plants and animals, including many large mammals such as moose, elk, mule deer, black bear, and cougars. This area has been affected by the non-native plant species, yellow toadflax. The most common trees are Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir and lodgepole pine, with aspen groves at lower elevations. The top of the plateau is alpine tundra. The highest point in the Flat Tops is the summit of Flat Top Mountain (12,361 ft) on the east side of the range. The Devil's Causeway, perhaps the most popular geologic feature and notorious hiking experience in the Flat Tops, is located in the same area. The Causeway is a narrow neck of the plateau where eroding glaciers on either side almost met. A trail crosses the Causeway which at its narrowest is 3 to 4 feet wide with drop-offs of hundreds of feet to the valleys on either side.","The Flat Tops is a mountain range located in the Rocky Mountains of North America.

It is a rather small pale yellow species that is indigenous to the Americas and can be found living in the foliage of forests and gardens but also can inhabit human homes. Despite common beliefs of necrosis, Cheiracanthium bites cause only localized swelling. C. inclusum is closely related to Cheiracanthium mildei, an introduced species native to Europe which is similar in appearance and natural history and can also be found in North American homes. Identification
Like all spiders, C. inclusum has two body segments: a cephalothorax (fused head and thorax) and an abdomen. In females, the body measures between 5 and 9 mm and in males, 4 to 8 mm. The leg span however can be up to  with the front pair of legs being longer than the other 3 pairs. Males tend to have a narrower body and a larger leg span than females. C. inclusum gets its two common names (yellow sac and black-footed spider) from its appearance. It is a pale yellow-beige colour with dark brown markings on its palps, chelicerae (jaws) and on the ends of its tarsi (feet). There is also often an orange-brown stripe running down the top-centre of its abdomen. 
C. inclusum has 8 similarly sized eyes, distributed in 2 parallel horizontal rows. However, ocular input is of minor import, due to the absence of light during the spider's nocturnal activities. The spider relies more on its palps, sensory structures just behind the chelicerae, on the cephalothorax, to sense its environment.","Cheiracanthium inclusum, alternately known as the black-footed ferret, is a small mustelid that ranges throughout much of North America.

The sentence may contain several such variables (e.g. n variables, in which case the function takes n arguments). Overview
As a mathematical function, A(x) or A(x, x, ..., x), the propositional function is abstracted from predicates or propositional forms.  As an example, consider the predicate scheme, ""x is hot"".  The substitution of any entity for x will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though ""x is hot"" on its own has no value as either a true or false statement.  However, when a value is assigned to x , such as lava, the function then has the value true; while one assigns to x a value like ice, the function then has the value false.","In propositional calculus, a propositional function or propositional operator is a mathematical function that takes one or more propositions as input and produces a single proposition as output.

Cirquents come in a variety of forms, but they all share one main characteristic feature, making them different from the more traditional objects of syntactic manipulation. This feature is the ability to explicitly account for possible sharing of subcomponents between different components. For instance, it is possible to write an expression where two subexpressions F and E, while neither one is a subexpression of the other, still have a common occurrence of a subexpression G (as opposed to having two different occurrences of G, one in F and one in E). Overview
The approach was introduced by G. Japaridze in  as an alternative proof theory capable of “taming” various nontrivial fragments of his computability logic, which had otherwise resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof-theoretic frameworks. The origin of the term “cirquent” is CIRcuit+seQUENT, as the simplest form of cirquents, while resembling circuits rather than formulas, can be thought of as collections of one-sided sequents (for instance, sequents of a given level of a Gentzen-style proof tree) where some sequents may have shared elements.  ","Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that focusses on the use of cirques to prove properties about mathematical expressions.

Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that focusses on the use of cirques to prove properties about mathematical expressions. Cirquent calculus was developed by Simon Polak and is described in his thesis ""Cirquent Calculus: A New Proof Language and its Applications"" (PDF). cirques are a type of looping structure often found in mathematics and computer science, used to represent recursive functions. In cirquent calculus, a cirque is used to represent a function that takes one input and returns another input. The function can be represented as a set of nested loops, where each loop contains the input and output of the previous loop.

One of the main benefits of using cirques to represent functions is that they can be easily mapped onto structural equation models (SEM). SEMs are a popular tool for predicting the outcomes of complex interactions between variables. By mapping cirques onto SEMs, it is possible to automatically determine the effects of changes to the variables on the outcome. This allows for more accurate predictions than would be possible with traditional methods.

According to this theory, space and time emerged together  ago, and the universe has been expanding ever since. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, the cosmic inflation equation indicates that it must have a minimum diameter of 23 trillion light years, and it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day. The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.",The universe  is all of space and time and the physical and natural substances that exist in it.

In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth and who are pregnant with one baby, and have shortening of the cervical length less than 25 mm, a cerclage prevents a preterm birth and reduces death and illness in the baby. The treatment consists of a strong suture sewn into and around the cervix early in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 12 to 14, and then removed towards the end of the pregnancy when the greatest risk of miscarriage has passed. The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, usually by way of a spinal block. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis by an obstetrician-gynecologist. Usually the treatment is done in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who has had one or more late miscarriages in the past.

There are, however, a number of notable differences between the Zeppelin NT and original Zeppelins as well as between the Zeppelin NT and usual non-rigid airships known as blimps. The Zeppelin NT is classified as a semi-rigid airship. There are various roles for the Zeppelin NT; traditional roles have been aerial tourism purposes and for conducting passenger services. The hull surfaces of the aircraft have also been used for advertising purposes. The Zeppelin NT have also been used for observation platforms, such as for aerial photographers and by television commentators covering major events. Due to their capability for low-vibration flight for up to 24 hours at a time, ZLT considers the airships suitable for research missions for environmental observation, troposphere research and natural resource prospecting.","The Zeppelin NT (""Neue Technologie"", German for ""New Technology"") was the first airship ever to be built and flown by humans.

The editor of One Big Union Monthly, John Sandgren, used his position to wage war on the Communists in the IWW. When his editorials became too sectarian, the IWW replaced him as editor in 1931, and changed the name of the publication to the Industrial Pioneer. The new editor was a Communist, however, and this alienated the non-Communist majority of IWW members. He was removed as editor in 1922. By the end of 1923, the IWW publications Industrial Pioneer and Industrial Worker were both nearly bankrupt. An organizer with experience in the Oklahoma oil fields, Frank Gallagher, became business manager for both.

It infects the gills of several species of flatfish, particularly the European flounder (Platichthys flesus). Copepodids and immature females infect the holobranch of the host, while adult females prefer the pseudobranch and the internal wall, suggesting they migrate upstream in the gills of the host as they mature. Reproduction
Males in this species are several times smaller than the females, and attach themselves permanently onto special 'nuptial organs' on their mates. These organs are paired, and therefore a single female can sometimes hold two males. In Portuguese waters, reproduction happens year round, and at least two generations are seemingly produced per year, a summer-autumn generation, and a winter-spring generation. Females of the former are smaller and produce less eggs, while those of the latter are larger and more fecund but produce smaller eggs.","Acanthochondria cornuta is a species of parasitic worm in the family Acanthocephali. It is found in the Amazon Basin of Brazil and Peru.

Acanthochondria cornuta is a small species of parasitic worm, measuring 2-3 cm in length, that lives in the gut of the giant otter, Lontra canadensis. The worm was first described from specimens collected in the Brasília area of Brazil, but has since been found in a wider range of habitats around the Amazon Basin, including rivers, lakes, and wetlands.

Acanthochondria cornuta is a facultative anaerobe that grows best in environments with high levels of oxygen availability. The worm feeds on bacteria and other small invertebrates that live in the gut of its host, and excretes a digestive fluid that contains bacteria and enzymes that digest the host's food. This process allows the parasite to absorb nutrients directly from its host's bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system entirely.

Shulgin himself referred to this substance as a “pharmacological tofu,” meaning that when mixed with other substances, it can extend or potentiate their effects without coloring the experience too much, in a manner similar to how tofu absorbs the flavors of sauces or spices it is cooked with.

The type and only species, P. olsoni, was named in 1987 from the Wellington Formation of Oklahoma, which is Early Permian in age. It is known from several skulls and partial remains of vertebrae and limbs. It has large orbits, or eye sockets, and large otic notches (rounded indentations at the back of the skull). A bone called the palatine, which is usually found on the underside of the skull, is partially exposed on the top of the skull. Present on the margin of the orbit, the palatine takes the place of the lacrimal bone, which usually touches the orbit in temnospondyls. Another distinguishing feature of Perryella is the presence of two small projections on the quadratojugal bone at the back of the skull. The lowermost projection forms a cup-like shape that attaches to the lower jaw. The classification of Perryella was at first uncertain because it shared features with two groups, Trimerorhachidae and Dissorophoidea, which were thought to be distantly related. In 2006, a phylogenetic analysis involving Perryella placed it within Dvinosauria as an intermediate form between trimerorhachids and other dvinosaurs.","Perryella is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian theropod dinosaur that lived in the Late Cretaceous Period, about 80 million years ago. It was a small, slender dvinosaurian, with a long tail and a small head. It was the only known member of its genus.

Perryella was first described by American palaeontologist Charles Whitney in 1927. The type specimen, NHMUK R.5337, is a partial skeleton that consists of the skull, forelimbs, and hindlimbs. It is missing the front legs and most of the tail. The skeleton was discovered in the Isle of Wight in southern England.

Sheaves can be used to redirect a cable or rope, lift loads, and transmit power. The words sheave and pulley are sometimes used interchangeably. Adjustable pulley
A sheave can also refer to a pulley which has an adjustable operating diameter for use with a mechanical belt. This is accomplished by constructing the pulley out of several pieces. The two main ""halves"" of the pulley can be moved closer together or farther apart, thus altering the operational diameter. The usual construction is some sort of locking collar or set screws to secure the components, one half with a threaded central shaft and one half with a threaded center. By rotating the components, one can ""screw"" the parts closer together or further apart, thus changing the distance between the two halves and allowing the belt to ride higher or lower in the groove. The adjustments are constrained to a specific range of sizes and are not limitless. One application of this is the Variomatic automatic transmission.","A sheave  or pulley wheel is a rotating device used to lift heavy objects. It is also known as a hoist or lift.

The gas balloon is filled with a lifting gas and provides the buoyancy, while the superpressure balloon is filled with air, and pressurized to provide the desired ballast weight. In a passive sky anchor, the superpressure balloon is sealed, while in an active system, its pressure can be varied. Both versions have been tested in flight, but have had frequent failures with only occasional successful outcomes. The tandem arrangement makes launching difficult, and this complexity can lead to mission failure. The tandem balloon system is intended to increase the flight time of the zero-pressure balloon by damping the diurnal  altitude variations caused by solar heating of the lifting gas and its subsequent expansion. As the balloons descend, the superpressure balloon's constant volume displaces a larger mass of the denser air, and becomes more buoyant. Likewise as they rise, the system displaces less air mass, limiting the ascent to prevent the lifting gas from expanding too far and escaping from the zero pressure balloon.","A sky anchor is a system of ropes, cables and pulleys used to maintain a particular altitude in the presence of wind or air currents. It is also an aerial navigation device which is attached to a moving body, such as an aircraft, spacecraft, or ship.

The Shitanoya site is located in the lowlands  on the south bank of the Shakujii River, and consists of a pair of ring-shaped settlements from the middle of the Jōmon period. These settlements are divided by a small creek, and it is uncertain if they existed simultaneously. The larger is on the west side, and has a diameter of about 150 meters. The site contains the foundations of a number of pit dwellings, a cemetery, and a group of raised-floor buildings, presumed to be granaries, arranged around a central plaza. It was inhabited for approximately a thousand years. Such circular settlements from the middle Jōmon period (about 5,000 to 4,000 years ago) are widely distributed in Kantō and Kōshin'etsu regions, and the Musashino Terrace and Tama Hills have the second highest density of such settlements next to the cluster at the southern foot of Mount Yatsugatake in Nagano Prefecture. ","The  is an archaeological site in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. It is located on the eastern slope of Mount Futatsugi, about 6 km east of the city of Kumamoto. The site is thought to have been occupied from the Jōmon period through the Heian period.

The site was first identified in 1900, and in 1936–1937 excavations by the Japanese Archaeological Association unearthed a number of early post-Jōmon period sites. The most important discovery was an 8th century CE grave which yielded a number of artifacts, including a bronze mirror. The site was re-excavated in 1988 by the Kumamoto University Museum, and in 2000–2001 by the Kumamoto City Museum.

The Shitanoya Site covers an area of about 2.4 hectares and has been divided into three sections based on archaeological features:

The green jack is distinguished from other similar carangid species by a number of features including gill raker and lateral line scale counts, and the presence of an adipose eyelid. It is a moderately large species, growing to at least 55 cm in length and 2.81 kg, although unconfirmed reports suggest a much larger maximum size. It lives in a wide range of continental shelf environments including estuaries, bays, reefs and offshore seamounts, living both pelagically and demersally. The green jack is a predatory species, preying on  a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, as well as zooplankton. Most fish are sexually mature by the time they attain 38 cm, with spawning occurring between May and October. The species is of high importance to fisheries throughout its range, caught by pelagic trawls, a variety of netting methods and hook and line.

Until he reached maturity (then defined as his 13th birthday) on 15 February 1723, the kingdom was ruled by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, as Regent of France.
Cardinal Fleury was chief minister from 1726 until his death in 1743, at which time the king took sole control of the kingdom. His reign of almost 59 years (from 1715 to 1774) was the second longest in the history of France, exceeded only by his predecessor, Louis XIV, who had ruled for 72 years (from 1643 to 1715).  In 1748, Louis returned the Austrian Netherlands, won at the Battle of Fontenoy of 1745. He ceded New France in North America to Great Britain and Spain at the conclusion of the disastrous Seven Years' War in 1763. He incorporated the territories of the Duchy of Lorraine and the Corsican Republic into the Kingdom of France. Historians generally criticise his reign, citing how reports of his corruption embarrassed the monarchy, while his wars drained the treasury while producing little gain.

Topological insulators have non-trivial symmetry-protected topological order; however, having a conducting surface is not unique to topological insulators, since ordinary band insulators can also support conductive surface states. What is special about topological insulators is that their surface states are symmetry-protected Dirac fermions by particle number conservation and time-reversal symmetry. In two-dimensional (2D) systems, this ordering is analogous to a conventional electron gas subject to a strong external magnetic field causing electronic excitation gap in the sample bulk and metallic conduction at the boundaries or surfaces. The distinction between 2D and 3D topological insulators is characterized by the Z-2 topological invariant, which defines the ground state. In 2D, there is a single Z-2 invariant distinguishing the insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase, while in 3D, there are four Z-2 invariant that differentiate the insulator from “weak” and “strong” topological insulators.",A topological insulator is a material that does not allow any current to flow through it unless an energy source is applied.

In August 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, he joined John Becker, Candice Keller, and Nino Vitale in sponsoring a move to impeach against Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor. The move was widely and immediately panned on both sides of the aisle and by legal scholars and commentators. Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken ""issued a scathing condemnation of the trio of conservatives"", calling the move “a baseless, feeble attempt at creating attention for themselves.” Ohio House Speaker, Republican Bob Cupp, called it an ""imprudent attempt"" to cause ""a state constitutional crisis"". Legal scholar Jonathan Entin said the proposal ""means that we’ve distorted our understanding both of what impeachment is supposed to do and how people – especially, elected officials – are supposed to disagree with each other. Do we really want to say that the government can’t act in an emergency because the officials are afraid that if they do anything, they’ll be removed from office? Of course, if they don’t do anything, maybe the response is going to be ‘Well you should be impeached for not acting.'

In a June 2016 attack, the windows of the mosque were shattered. History
The construction of the Şehzade Complex (külliye) was ordered by the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent as a memorial to his favorite son Şehzade Mehmed (born 1521) who died in 1543 while returning to Istanbul after a victorious military campaign in Hungary. Mehmed was the eldest son of Suleiman's only legal wife Hürrem Sultan - although not his eldest son - and before his untimely death he was primed to accept the sultanate following Suleiman's reign. Suleiman is said to have personally mourned the death of Mehmed for forty days at his temporary tomb in Istanbul, the site upon which the imperial architect Mimar Sinan would construct a lavish mausoleum to Mehmed as one part of a larger mosque complex dedicated to the princely heir. The complex was Sinan's first important imperial commission and ultimately one of his most ambitious architectural works, even though it was designed early in his long career.","The Şehzade Mosque (, from the original name ""Şehzade Sultan Mosque"") is a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, built by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror between 1451 and 1453.

It is used by glycosyltransferases to transfer N-acetylglucosamine residues to substrates. D-Glucosamine is made naturally in the form of glucosamine-6-phosphate, and is the biochemical precursor of all nitrogen-containing sugars. To be specific, glucosamine-6-phosphate is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine as the first step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway.  The end-product of this pathway is UDP-GlcNAc, which is then used for making glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. UDP-GlcNAc is extensively involved in intracellular signaling as a substrate for O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferases (OGTs) to install the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification in a wide range of species. It is also involved in nuclear pore formation and nuclear signalling. OGTs and OG-ases play an important role in the structure of the cytoskeleton. In mammals, there is enrichment of OGT transcripts in the pancreas beta-cells, and  UDP-GlcNAc is thought to be part of the glucose sensing mechanism. There is also evidence that it plays a part in insulin sensitivity in other cells.

President Ulysses S. Grant signed the act the day before his inauguration for a second term to double the salary of the president and those of Supreme Court Justices. The proposal for a salary increase was fueled by what was considered low pay for members in government, while the salary for the president was the same as it had been for George Washington. The bill subsequently included a 50 percent salary increase for the president and for members of Congress, retroactive to the beginning of their term, which was the most highly contested provision in the bill. Public outcry led Congress to rescind the congressional salary increase. As a protest against the act, Ohio ratified what later became the Twenty-seventh Amendment.

He was a guide for Stephen Harriman Long's expedition of the Great Plains in 1820. A fur trapper and hunter, he lived among the Pawnee people. He was able to communicate to a number of Native American tribes through his use of sign language as well as the Crow language, which was used among a number of western tribes.

Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.","Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that increasingly cheaper and more accessible digital technologies afford individual actors to engage in various forms of communication, activism, and knowledge production. It has been argued that mass amateurization has implications for democracy, as it enables citizens to engage in public life without the requisite qualifications or formal training.

The term was first used in a 2002 article by sociologist Manuel Castells, who described the phenomenon as follows:

""Mass amateurization is the ability of large numbers of people to participate in the public sphere without the necessary qualifications or formal training. It is a consequence of new technologies and changing social conditions. The new media have made it possible for anyone with an Internet connection to become a journalist, a filmmaker, or an activist. As a result, many people who would never have had the opportunity to become involved in public life are now able to do so.""
